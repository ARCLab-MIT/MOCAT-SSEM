function [pattern] = updateParallel(stepSize, workerDirName)
%UPDATEPARALLEL Update function when ProgressBar is used in parallel setup
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function replaces the update() method of the ProgressBar() class
% when a progress in a parfor loop should be displayed. The function writes
% by default to a temp file in the local temp dir. Each worker will call a
% copy of this function and if a persistent file name variable is not yet
% set a unique file name will be generated and a binary file will be
% initialized. Each worker remembers its own file name to write to and will
% update its own current progress and write it to file. The ProgressBar()
% class will handle the management of all worker files.
% 
%
% Usage: [pattern] = updateParallel(stepSize, workerDirName)
%
%   Input:   ---------
%           stepSize - the size of the progress step when the function is
%                      called. This can be used to pass the number of
%                      processed bytes when using 'Bytes' as units. If
%                      bytes are used be sure to pass only integer values.
%                      [default: stepSize = 1]
%           workerDirName - directory where the worker aux. files will be
%                           saved. This can be specified for debug purposes
%                           or if multiple progress bars in a parallel
%                           setup would get in each other's way since all
%                           have the same file pattern and would distract
%                           each progress bar's progress state.
%                           [default: workerDirName = tempdir()]
%
%  Output:   ---------
%        filePattern - the common beginning of every file name before the
%                      unique part begins. This is an auxiliary function
%                      output which is used by the ProgressBar() class.
%                      Typically not be of interest for the user. The
%                      variable is only returned if no input arguments were
%                      passed!
