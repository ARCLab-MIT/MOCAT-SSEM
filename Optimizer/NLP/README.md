# A Stable and Sustainable Maximum Orbital Capacity in Low Earth Orbit

## Description

A constrained nonlinear programming (NLP) optimization problem is formulated to compute the maximum orbital capacity of the low region of LEO, considering equilibrium points and the failure rate of the satellites as constraints. 
A three species MOCAT-SSEM is considered, with active satellites (S), derelicts (D), and debris (N).


## System requirements

Matlab with Optimization Toolbox.


## Installation guide

Download this folder and run main file: "optimal_capacity.m".


## Demo/Output

The main file "optimal_capacity.m" is set to reproduce the results of Case 1 reported in Table 2 and Figure 2. Run time is usually in the order of seconds.
