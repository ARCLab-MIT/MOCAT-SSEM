A constrained nonlinear programming (NLP) optimization problem is 
formulated to compute the maximum orbital capacity of the low region of 
LEO, considering equilibrium points and the failure rate of the 
satellites as constraints. 
A three species MOCAT-SSEM is considered, with active satellites (S), 
derelicts (D), and debris (N).
