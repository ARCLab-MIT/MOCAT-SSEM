 
Toolkit Contents Description
===========================================================================
 
 
Introduction
===========================================================================
 
   This document describes the structure and contents of the latest version
   of the NAIF mice Toolkit for PC computers using MICROSOFT WINDOWS
   operating system.
 
   Most C compilers come with a large set of compilation options that can
   be used when compiling source code. The compiler options we (NAIF) used
   when creating the various object libraries are discussed in the section
   "LIB" that appears later in this document.
 
 
Version Information
--------------------------------------------------------
 
      Creation Date: Sat Jan  1 19:20:13 PST 2022
      Version      : MICE.................V.N0067
 
 
Directory Structure and Contents
===========================================================================
 
   The top level directory, mice, contains the file makeall.bat. This is a
   script that builds all of the object libraries and executables in the
   mice Toolkit.
 
      (installation directory)
         |
         mice
            |
            makeall.bat
 
   It may optionally contain a zero-size file named N????, e.g. N0067,
   indicating the generic SPICE Toolkit version on which this package is
   based.
 
   mice also contains several subdirectories that will be described in more
   detail in the following sections.

INCLUDE

   The INCLUDE directory contains all of the mice Toolkit include files
   that are part of the public interface to the CSPICE library. Users will
   need to include the master include file SpiceUsr.h into their C code
   that references CSPICE functions. Code that references underlying f2c'd
   routines directly should include SpiceZfc.h as well.

LIB
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The LIB directory contains the object libraries for this mice Toolkit
   package.
 
   All static libraries are compiled using the following compiler options:
 
      /c /O2 -D_COMPLEX_DEFINED -DMSDOS -DOMIT_BLANK_CC
      -DNON_ANSI_STDIO
 
   One routine, zzsecprt.c, is compiled without the /O2 optimization
   option, because the MS Visual C++/C compiler is unable to process the
   routine correctly when using this optimization feature.
 
   The libraries contained in this directory are listed below. Each library
   is discussed in more detail later in the section devoted to the SRC
   directory.

SRC
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The SRC directory contains one subdirectory for each product in the mice
   Toolkit. Each of these product directories contains the source code
   files and procedures to create the executable or object library.

   converts transfer format SPK, CK and EK files to binary format, it
   converts binary SPK, CK and EK files to transfer format, and it
   summarizes the contents of binary SPK, CK and EK files.
 
   This directory contains the SPACIT main program, supporting routines,
   and a script to create the executable program spacit.

MICE
 
   MICE is the ANSI C based interface between the MATLAB environment, a

   This directory contains the MICE C and MATLAB source code and a script
   to create the MICE shared object library.

Using the Toolkit
===========================================================================
 
 
All Users
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   After completing your Toolkit installation it is extremely important
   that you carefully read the ``whats.new'' description of changes and
   additions if you haven't done so prior to the installation.
 
   The Toolkit contains two styles of documentation: a plain text version
   and a hyper-linked HTML version. NAIF recommends you use the HTML
   version because of the convenience of the hyper-linking. To do that load
   the top level index of the HTML documentation -- ``doc/html/index.html''
   -- into a web browser.
 
 
Repeat Users
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   If you are not a first time user, save your own application executables
   in a safe place and then re-link those application programs to the newly
   installed library, creating new executables. NAIF suggests you carefully
   re-test any critical applications to be sure they are working correctly
   -- you may have unknowingly taken advantage of a bug in the old library
   that has since been fixed.
 
   Be aware that sometimes a bug fix or a small algorithmic change in the
   new SPICE code could result in small changes in numeric results; this
   could show up in your regression test cases.
 
 
First Time Users
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   NAIF provides several means to help you get started using SPICE --
   tutorials, ``open book'' programming lessons, several ``cookbook
   programs,'' and extensive documentation. Which of these will best suit
   your needs, and in what order you should use these materials, depends on
   your training/background and your immediate needs for using SPICE. NAIF
   suggests you become familiar with the offerings from the NAIF website
   (http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov), most particularly the tutorials and lessons
   collections. You might also take time to read the ``Introduction to the
   SPICE System'' document.
 
   Please note that NAIF assumes you are familiar with how to write code in
   the language you have chosen, and that you know how to compile, link
   (``make'') and execute programs on your computer. If this is not the
   case you should first take some generic programming lessons before
   trying to tackle SPICE.
 
 
Appendix -- NAIF's File Naming Conventions
===========================================================================
 
   NAIF follows a set of conventions for naming files based on the contents
   of the files. This allows you to find certain types of files in a
   directory tree quickly.
