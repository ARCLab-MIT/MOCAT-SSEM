   CSPICE_SPKAPO returns the position of a target body relative to an
   observer, optionally corrected for light time and stellar aberration.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      targ     the NAIF ID code for a target body.

               [1,1] = size(targ); int32 = class(targ)

               The target and observer define a position vector which
               points from the observer to the target.

      et       the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB, at
               which the position of the target body relative to the
               observer is to be computed.

               [1,1] = size(et); double = class(et)

               `et' refers to time at the observer's location.

      ref      the inertial reference frame with respect to which the
               observer's state `sobs' is expressed.

               [1,c1] = size(ref); char = class(ref)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(ref); cell = class(ref)

               `ref' must be recognized by the SPICE Toolkit. The
               acceptable frames are listed in the Frames Required Reading.

               Case and blanks are not significant in the string
               `ref'.

      sobs     the geometric (uncorrected) state of the observer relative to
               the solar system barycenter at epoch et.

               [6,1] = size(sobs); double = class(sobs)

               `sobs' is a 6-vector: the first three components of `sobs'
               represent a Cartesian position vector; the last three
               components represent the corresponding velocity vector.
               `sobs' is expressed relative to the inertial reference frame
               designated by `ref'.

               Units are always km and km/sec.


      abcorr   indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to the
               position of the target body to account for one-way light time
               and stellar aberration.

               [1,c2] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               See the discussion in the -Particulars section for
               recommendations on how to choose aberration corrections.

               `abcorr' may be any of the following:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric position of the target body
                             relative to the observer.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at et:

                  'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the position of the target at the
                             moment it emitted photons arriving at
                             the observer at et.

                             The light time correction involves
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation (see -Particulars for details).
                             The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                             uses one iteration.

                  'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             position obtained with the 'LT' option
                             to account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent
                             position of the target---the position
                             of the target as seen by the observer.

                  'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                             until the solution converges (three
                             iterations on all supported platforms).
                             Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                             substantially more accurate than the
                             'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                             of the participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed. See the -Particulars section of
                             <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a> for a discussion of precision of
                             light time corrections.

                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction and stellar aberration
                             correction.


               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             position of the target at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                  'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation  This option modifies the
                             position obtained with the 'XLT' option
                             to account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The target position
                             indicates the direction that photons
                             emitted from the observer's location
                             must be &quot;aimed&quot; to hit the target.

                  'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged Newtonian
                             light time correction and stellar
                             aberration correction.

               Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
               accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
               by this routine.

               Case and blanks are not significant in the string
               `abcorr'.

   the call:

      [ptarg, lt] = <b>cspice_spkapo</b>( targ, et, ref, sobs, abcorr )

   returns:

      ptarg    a Cartesian 3-vector representing the position of the target
               body relative to the specified observer.

               [3,1] = size(ptarg); double = class(ptarg)

               `ptarg' is corrected for the specified aberrations, and is
               expressed with respect to the specified inertial reference
               frame. The components of `ptarg' represent the x-, y- and
               z-components of the target's position.

               Units are always km.

               The vector `ptarg' points from the observer's position
               at `et' to the aberration-corrected location of the
               target. Note that the sense of the position vector is
               independent of the direction of radiation travel
               implied by the aberration correction.

      lt       the one-way light time between the observer and target in
               seconds.

               [1,1] = size(lt); double = class(lt)

               If the target position is corrected for aberrations, then
               `lt' is the one-way light time between the observer and the
               light time corrected target location.

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Compute the apparent position of the Moon relative to the
      Earth, corrected for one light-time and stellar aberration,
      given the geometric state of the Earth relative to the Solar
      System Barycenter, and the difference between the stellar
      aberration corrected and uncorrected position vectors, taking
      several steps.

      First, compute the light-time corrected state of the Moon body
      as seen by the Earth, using its geometric state. Then apply
      the correction for stellar aberration to the light-time
      corrected state of the target body.

      The code in this example could be replaced by a single call
      to <a href="cspice_spkpos.html">cspice_spkpos</a>:

         [pos, lt] = <a href="cspice_spkpos.html">cspice_spkpos</a>( 'MOON',  et,     ...

   In space science or engineering applications one frequently
   wishes to know where to point a remote sensing instrument, such
   as an optical camera or radio antenna, in order to observe or
   otherwise receive radiation from a target. This pointing problem
   is complicated by the finite speed of light: one needs to point
   to where the target appears to be as opposed to where it actually
   is at the epoch of observation. We use the adjectives
   &quot;geometric,&quot; &quot;uncorrected,&quot; or &quot;true&quot; to refer to an actual
   position or state of a target at a specified epoch. When a
   geometric position or state vector is modified to reflect how it
   appears to an observer, we describe that vector by any of the
   terms &quot;apparent,&quot; &quot;corrected,&quot; &quot;aberration corrected,&quot; or &quot;light
   time and stellar aberration corrected.&quot;

   The SPICE Toolkit can correct for two phenomena affecting the
   apparent location of an object: one-way light time (also called
   &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) and stellar aberration. Correcting for
   one-way light time is done by computing, given an observer and
   observation epoch, where a target was when the observed photons
   departed the target's location. The vector from the observer to
   this computed target location is called a &quot;light time corrected&quot;
   vector. The light time correction depends on the motion of the
   target, but it is independent of the velocity of the observer
   relative to the solar system barycenter. Relativistic effects
   such as light bending and gravitational delay are not accounted
   for in the light time correction performed by this routine.

   The velocity of the observer also affects the apparent location
   of a target: photons arriving at the observer are subject to a
   &quot;raindrop effect&quot; whereby their velocity relative to the observer
   is, using a Newtonian approximation, the photons' velocity
   relative to the solar system barycenter minus the velocity of the
   observer relative to the solar system barycenter. This effect is
   called &quot;stellar aberration.&quot; Stellar aberration is independent
   of the motion of the target. The stellar aberration formula used
   by this routine is non- relativistic.

   Stellar aberration corrections are applied after light time
   corrections: the light time corrected target position vector is
   used as an input to the stellar aberration correction.

   When light time and stellar aberration corrections are both
   applied to a geometric position vector, the resulting position
   vector indicates where the target &quot;appears to be&quot; from the
   observer's location.

   As opposed to computing the apparent position of a target, one
   may wish to compute the pointing direction required for
   transmission of photons to the target. This requires correction
   of the geometric target position for the effects of light time and
   stellar aberration, but in this case the corrections are computed
   for radiation traveling from the observer to the target.

   The &quot;transmission&quot; light time correction yields the target's
   location as it will be when photons emitted from the observer's
   location at `et' arrive at the target. The transmission stellar
   aberration correction is the inverse of the traditional stellar
   aberration correction: it indicates the direction in which
   radiation should be emitted so that, using a Newtonian
   approximation, the sum of the velocity of the radiation relative
   to the observer and of the observer's velocity, relative to the
   solar system barycenter, yields a velocity vector that points in
   the direction of the light time corrected position of the target.

   The traditional aberration corrections applicable to observation
   and those applicable to transmission are related in a simple way:
   one may picture the geometry of the &quot;transmission&quot; case by
   imagining the &quot;observation&quot; case running in reverse time order,
   and vice versa.

   One may reasonably object to using the term &quot;observer&quot; in the
   transmission case, in which radiation is emitted from the
   observer's location. The terminology was retained for
   consistency with earlier documentation.

   Below, we indicate the aberration corrections to use for some
   common applications:

      1) Find the apparent direction of a target. This is
         the most common case for a remote-sensing observation.

            Use 'LT+S' or 'CN+S': apply both light time and stellar
            aberration corrections.

         Note that using light time corrections alone ('LT') is
         generally not a good way to obtain an approximation to an
         apparent target vector: since light time and stellar
         aberration corrections often partially cancel each other,
         it may be more accurate to use no correction at all than to
         use light time alone.


      2) Find the corrected pointing direction to radiate a signal
         to a target. This computation is often applicable for
         implementing communications sessions.

            Use 'XLT+S' or 'XCN+S': apply both light time and stellar
            aberration corrections for transmission.


      3) Compute the apparent position of a target body relative
         to a star or other distant object.

            Use one of 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', or 'CN+S' as needed to match
            the correction applied to the position of the distant
            object. For example, if a star position is obtained from a
            catalog, the position vector may not be corrected for
            stellar aberration. In this case, to find the angular
            separation of the star and the limb of a planet, the vector
            from the observer to the planet should be corrected for
            light time but not stellar aberration.


      4) Obtain an uncorrected state vector derived directly from
         data in an SPK file.

            Use 'NONE'.


      5) Use a geometric state vector as a low-accuracy estimate
         of the apparent state for an application where execution
         speed is critical.

            Use 'NONE'.


      6) While this routine cannot perform the relativistic
         aberration corrections required to compute states
         with the highest possible accuracy, it can supply the
         geometric states required as inputs to these computations.

            Use 'NONE', then apply relativistic aberration
            corrections (not available in the SPICE Toolkit).


   Below, we discuss in more detail how the aberration corrections
   applied by this routine are computed.


   Geometric case
   ==============

      <b>cspice_spkapo</b> begins by computing the geometric position targ(et) of
      the target body relative to the solar system barycenter (SSB).
      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer obs(et) gives
      the geometric position of the target body relative to the
      observer. The one-way light time, `lt', is given by

               | targ(et) - obs(et) |
         lt = ------------------------
                         C

      The geometric relationship between the observer, target, and
      solar system barycenter is as shown:


          SSB ---&gt; obs(et)
           |      /
           |     /
           |    /
           |   /  targ(et) - obs(et)
           V  V
         targ(et)


      The returned position vector is

         targ(et) - obs(et)


   Reception case
   ==============

      When any of the options 'LT', 'CN', 'LT+S', 'CN+S' are
      selected, <b>cspice_spkapo</b> computes the position of the target body at
      epoch et-lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time. Let targ(t)
      and obs(t) represent the positions of the target and observer
      relative to the solar system barycenter at time `t'; then `lt'
      is the solution of the
      light-time equation

               | targ(et-lt) - obs(et) |
         lt = ---------------------------                         (1)
                           C

      The ratio

          | targ(et) - obs(et) |
         ------------------------                                 (2)
                    C

      is used as a first approximation to `lt'; inserting (2) into the
      RHS of the light-time equation (1) yields the 'one-iteration'
      estimate of the one-way light time. Repeating the process
      until the estimates of lt converge yields the &quot;converged
      Newtonian&quot; light time estimate.

      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer obs(et) gives
      the position of the target body relative to the observer:
      targ(et-lt) - obs(et).

           SSB ---&gt; obs(et)
            | \       |
            |  \      |
            |   \     | targ(et-lt) - obs(et)
            |    \    |
            |     \   |
            |      \  |
            V       V V
         targ(et)   targ(et-lt)


      The light-time corrected position is the vector

         targ(et-lt) - obs(et)

      If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
      position is rotated toward the solar system barycenter-relative
      velocity vector of the observer. The magnitude of the rotation
      depends on the magnitude of the observer's velocity relative
      to the solar system barycenter and the angle between
      this velocity and the observer-target vector. The rotation
      is computed as follows:

         Let `r' be the light time corrected vector from the observer
         to the object, and `v' be the velocity of the observer with
         respect to the solar system barycenter. Let `w' be the angle
         between them. The aberration angle phi is given by

            sin(phi) = v * sin(w) / c

         Let `h' be the vector given by the cross product

            h = r X v

         Rotate `r' by `phi' radians about `h' to obtain the apparent
         position of the object.



   Transmission case
   ==================

      When any of the options 'XLT', 'XCN', 'XLT+S', 'XCN+S' are
      selected, <b>cspice_spkapo</b> computes the position of the target body at
      epoch et+lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time.  `lt' is the
      solution of the light-time equation

               | targ(et+lt) - obs(et) |
         lt = ---------------------------                         (3)
                           C

      Subtracting the geometric position of the observer, obs(et),
      gives the position of the target body relative to the
      observer: targ(et-lt) - obs(et).

                     SSB --&gt; obs(et)
                    / |    *
                   /  |  *  targ(et+lt) - obs(et)
                  /   |*
                 /   *|
                V  V  V
         targ(et+lt)  targ(et)


      The light-time corrected position is

         targ(et+lt) - obs(et)

      If correction for stellar aberration is requested, the target
      position is rotated away from the solar system barycenter-
      relative velocity vector of the observer. The magnitude of the
      rotation depends on the magnitude of the velocity and the
      angle between the velocity and the observer-target vector.
      The rotation is computed as in the reception case, but the
      sign of the rotation angle is negated.

   Neither special nor general relativistic effects are accounted
   for in the aberration corrections performed by this routine.

   1)  If the value of `abcorr' is not recognized, the error
       SPICE(SPKINVALIDOPTION) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   2)  If the reference frame requested is not a recognized
       inertial reference frame, the error SPICE(BADFRAME) is

   This routine computes positions using SPK files that have been
   loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
   interface routine <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>. Application programs typically load
   kernels once before this routine is called, for example during
   program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly.
   See the routine <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading
   for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels.

   If any of the ephemeris data used to compute `ptarg' are expressed
   relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those
   data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference
   frame transformations required to compute `ptarg'. Normally
   these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels. Any
   such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is
   called.

</pre><h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  The ephemeris files to be used by <b>cspice_spkapo</b> must be loaded
       (normally by the Mice kernel loader <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>) before
       this routine is called.

   2)  Unlike most other SPK position computation routines, this
       routine requires that the input state be relative to an
       inertial reference frame. Non-inertial frames are not
       supported by this routine.

   3)  In a future version of this routine, the implementation
       of the aberration corrections may be enhanced to improve
       accuracy.
