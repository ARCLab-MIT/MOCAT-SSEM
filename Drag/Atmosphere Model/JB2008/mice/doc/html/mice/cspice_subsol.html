   Deprecated: This routine has been superseded by the Mice routine
   <a href="cspice_subslr.html">cspice_subslr</a>. This routine is supported for purposes of
   backward compatibility only.

   CSPICE_SUBSOL determines the coordinates of the sub-solar
   point on a target  body as seen by a specified observer at a
   specified epoch, optionally corrected for planetary (light time)
   and stellar aberration.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      method   a short string specifying the computation method to be used.

               [1,c1] = size(method); char = class(method)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(method); cell = class(method)

               The choices are:

                  'Near point'       The sub-solar point is defined
                                     as the nearest point on the
                                     target to the sun.

                  'Intercept'        The sub-observer point is
                                     defined as the target surface
                                     intercept of the line
                                     containing the target's center
                                     and the sun's center.

               In both cases, the intercept computation treats the
               surface of the target body as a triaxial ellipsoid.
               The ellipsoid's radii must be available in the kernel
               pool.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               `method'. For example, the string ' NEARPOINT' is
               valid.

      target   the name of the target body.

               [1,c2] = size(target); char = class(target)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

               `target' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for the
               object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate
               strings that indicate the moon is the target body.

               This routine assumes that the target body is modeled
               by a tri-axial ellipsoid, and that a PCK file
               containing its radii has been loaded into the kernel
               pool via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

      et       the epoch(s) in ephemeris seconds past J2000 at which the
               sub-solar point on the target body is to be computed.

               [1,1] = size(et); double = class(et)

      abcorr   indicates the aberration corrections to be applied when
               computing the observer-target state.

               [1,c3] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               abcorr may be any of the following.

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric sub-solar point on the target
                             body.

                  'LT'       Correct for planetary (light time)
                             aberration. Both the state and rotation
                             of the target body are corrected for one
                             way light time from target to observer.

                             The state of the sun relative to the
                             target is corrected for one way light
                             from the sun to the target; this state
                             is evaluated at the epoch obtained by
                             retarding `et' by the one way light time
                             from target to observer.

                  'LT+S'     Correct for planetary (light time) and
                             stellar aberrations. Light time
                             corrections are the same as in the 'LT'
                             case above. The target state is
                             additionally corrected for stellar
                             aberration as seen by the observer, and
                             the sun state is corrected for stellar
                             aberration as seen from the target.

                  'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                             until the solution converges (three
                             iterations on all supported platforms).
                             Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                             substantially more accurate than the
                             'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                             of the participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed. See the -Particulars section
                             of <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a> for a discussion of precision
                             of light time corrections. Light time
                             corrections are applied as in the 'LT'
                             case.

                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                             corrections and stellar aberration
                             correction. Light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections are applied as
                             in the 'LT+S' case.

      obsrvr   the name of the observing body, typically a spacecraft, the
               earth, or a surface point on the earth.

               [1,c4] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

               `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you may
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for the
               object. For example both 'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate
               strings that indicate the earth is the observer.

   the call:

      [spoint] = <b>cspice_subsol</b>( method, target, et, abcorr, obsrvr )

   returns:

      spoint   the sub-solar point(s) on the target body at `et' expressed
               relative to the body-fixed frame of the target body.

               [3,n] = size(spoint); double = class(spoint)

               The sub-solar point is defined either as the point on
               the target body that is closest to the sun, or the
               target surface intercept of the line containing the
               target's center and the sun's center; the input
               argument `method' selects the definition to be used.

               The body-fixed frame, which is time-dependent, is
               evaluated at `et' if `abcorr' is 'NONE'; otherwise the
               frame is evaluated at et-lt, where `lt' is the one way
               light time from target to observer.

               The state of the target body is corrected for
               aberration as specified by `abcorr'; the corrected
               state is used in the geometric computation. As
               indicated above, the rotation of the target is
               retarded by one way light time if `abcorr' specifies
               that light time correction is to be done.

               The state of the sun as seen from the observing
               body is also corrected for aberration as specified
               by `abcorr'. The corrections, when selected, are
               applied at the epoch et-lt, where `lt' is the one way
               light time from target to observer.

               `spoint' returns with the same vectorization measure, N,
               as `et'.

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Find the sub-solar position on the Earth as seen from the Moon at
      at epoch JAN 1, 2006 using the 'near point' then the 'intercept'
      options. Apply light time correction to return apparent position.

      Compute the distance between the location of the sub-solar
      points computed using the two different options, and the
      angular separation between their position vectors.

   <b>cspice_subsol</b> computes the sub-solar point on a target body, as seen by
   a specified observer.

   There are two different popular ways to define the sub-solar point:
   &quot;nearest point on target to the sun&quot; or &quot;target surface intercept of
   line containing target and sun.&quot; These coincide when the target is
   spherical and generally are distinct otherwise.

   When comparing sub-point computations with results from sources
   other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same geometric
   definitions are used.

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   If any of the listed errors occur, the output arguments are
   left unchanged.

   1)  If the input argument `method' is not recognized, the error
       SPICE(DUBIOUSMETHOD) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   2)  If either of the input body names `target' or `obsrvr' cannot be
       mapped to NAIF integer codes, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   3)  If `obsrvr' and `target' map to the same NAIF integer ID codes,
       the error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If frame definition data enabling the evaluation of the state
       of the target relative to the observer in target body-fixed
       coordinates have not been loaded prior to calling <b>cspice_subsol</b>, an
       error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this

       routine.

   6)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to
       calling <b>cspice_subsol</b>, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If the triaxial radii of the target body have not been loaded
       into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>cspice_subsol</b>, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   8)  If the size of the `target' body radii kernel variable is not
       three, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   9)  If any of the three `target' body radii is less-than or equal to
       zero, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   10) If PCK data supplying a rotation model for the target body
       have not been loaded prior to calling <b>cspice_subsol</b>, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   11) If any of the input arguments, `method', `target', `et',
       `abcorr' or `obsrvr', is undefined, an error is signaled by
       the Matlab error handling system.

   12) If any of the input arguments, `method', `target', `et',
       `abcorr' or `obsrvr', is not of the expected type, or it does
       not have the expected dimensions and size, an error is
       signaled by the Mice interface.

   Appropriate SPK, PCK, and frame data must be available to
   the calling program before this routine is called. Typically
   the data are made available by loading kernels; however the
   data may be supplied via routine interfaces if applicable.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for sun, target, and observer must
      be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
      sun, target, and observer relative to the solar system
      barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris
      data. Ephemeris data are made available by loading
      one or more SPK files via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  PCK data: triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded
      into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a
      text PCK file via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  Further PCK data:  a rotation model for the target body must
      be loaded. This may be provided in a text or binary PCK
      file which is loaded via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
      the sun, observer, and target states to the body-fixed frame
      of the target, that definition must be available in the
      kernel pool. Typically the definition is supplied by loading
      a frame kernel via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.
