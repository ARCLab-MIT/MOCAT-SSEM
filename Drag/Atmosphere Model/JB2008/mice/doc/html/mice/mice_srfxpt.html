   Deprecated: This routine has been superseded by the Mice routine
   <a href="cspice_sincpt.html">cspice_sincpt</a>. This routine is supported for purposes of
   backward compatibility only.

   MICE_SRFXPT computes the surface intercept point of a specified ray
   on a target body at a specified epoch, optionally corrected for light
   time and stellar aberration, given an observer and a direction vector
   defining a ray.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      method   a string providing parameters defining
               the computation method to use.

               [1,c1] = size(method); char = class(method)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(method); cell = class(method)

               The only currently supported choice:

                  &quot;Ellipsoid&quot;   The intercept computation uses
                                a triaxial ellipsoid to model
                                the surface of the target body.
                                The ellipsoid's radii must be
                                available in the kernel pool.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               `method'.

      target   the name of the target body.

               [1,c2] = size(target); char = class(target)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

               The target body is an ephemeris object (its trajectory is
               given by SPK data), and is an extended object. Optionally,
               you may supply the integer ID code for the object as an
               integer string, i.e. both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate
               strings that indicate the Moon is the target body.

      et       the ephemeris time(s), expressed as seconds past J2000
               TDB, at which to compute the surface intercept point on
               the target body (this epoch represents either the time of
               signal reception, or transmission, depending on the
               selected 'abcorr')

               [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)

      abcorr   the aberration correction to apply when computing the
               observer-target state and the target body orientation.

               [1,c3] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               For practical purposes, 'CN' (converged Newtonian)
               represents the best correction choice.

               `abcorr' may be any of the following:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric surface intercept point on the
                             target body.

               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the
               observer and the surface intercept point (note: NOT
               between the observer and the target body's center).
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               intercept point's location at the light-time
               corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's
               location at `et':


                  'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the location of the surface
                             intercept point at the moment it
                             emitted photons arriving at the
                             observer at `et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             'LT' option uses one iteration.

                             Both the target state as seen by the
                             observer, and rotation of the target
                             body, are corrected for light time.

                  'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent
                             surface intercept point as seen by the
                             observer.

                  'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                             until the solution converges. Both the
                             state and rotation of the target body
                             are corrected for light time.

                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                             and stellar aberration corrections.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the
               intercept point at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             intercept location at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             'LT' option uses one iteration.

                             Both the target state as seen by the
                             observer, and rotation of the target
                             body, are corrected for light time.

                  'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation  This option modifies the
                             intercept obtained with the 'XLT'
                             option to account for the observer's
                             velocity relative to the solar system
                             barycenter.

                  'XCN'      Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. This is the same as 'XLT'
                             correction but with further iterations
                             to a converged Newtonian light time
                             solution.

                  'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

      obsrvr   the name of a observing body.

               [1,c4] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

               Optionally, you may supply the integer ID code for the object
               as an integer string, i.e. both 'MOON' and '301' are
               legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the observing
               body.

      dref     the name of the reference frame relative to which the
               input direction vector is expressed.

               [1,c5] = size(dref); char = class(dref)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(dref); cell = class(dref)

               This may be any frame supported by the SPICE system, including
               built-in frames (documented in the Frames Required Reading)
               and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK).

               When `dref' designates a non-inertial frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch
               dependent on the frame's center and, if the center is
               not the observer, on the selected aberration
               correction. See the description of the direction
               vector `dvec' for details.

      dvec     the pointing vector emanating from the observer.

               [3,1] = size(dvec); double = class(dvec)

               The intercept with the target body's surface of the ray
               defined by the observer and `dvec' is sought.

               `dvec' is specified relative to the reference frame
               designated by `dref'.

               Non-inertial reference frames are treated as follows:
               if the center of the frame is at the observer's
               location, the frame is evaluated at `et'. If the
               frame's center is located elsewhere, then letting
               `ltcent' be the one-way light time between the observer
               and the central body associated with the frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at et-ltcent,
               et+ltcent, or `et' depending on whether the requested
               aberration correction is, respectively, for received
               radiation, transmitted radiation, or is omitted.
               `ltcent' is computed using the method indicated by
               `abcorr'.

   the call:

      [surf] = <b>mice_srfxpt</b>( method, target, et, abcorr, obsrvr, dref, dvec )

   returns:

      surf     the structure(s) containing the results of the calculation.

               [1,n] = size(surf); struct = class(surf)

               Each structure consists of the fields:

                  spoint   the surface intercept point on the target body of
                           the ray defined by the observer and the direction
                           vector.

                           [3,1]  = size(surf(i).spoint);
                           double = class(surf(i).spoint)

                           If the ray intersects the target body in
                           multiple points, the selected intersection point
                           is the one closest to the observer. The output
                           argument `found' (see below) indicates whether an
                           intercept was found.

                           `spoint' is expressed in Cartesian coordinates,
                           relative to the body-fixed frame associated with
                           the target body. The body-fixed target frame is
                           evaluated at the intercept epoch `trgepc' (see
                           description below).

                           When light time correction is used, the duration
                           of light travel between `spoint' to the observer
                           is considered to be the one way light time. When
                           both light time and stellar aberration corrections
                           are used, `spoint' is selected such that, when
                           `spoint' is corrected for light time and the
                           vector from the observer to the light-time
                           corrected location of `spoint' is corrected for
                           stellar aberration, the resulting vector is
                           parallel to the ray defined by the observer's
                           location and `dvec'.

                           The components of `spoint' are given in units of
                           km.

                  dist     the distance between the observer and the surface
                           intercept on the target body.

                           [1,1] = size(surf(i).dist);
                           double = class(surf(i).dist)

                           `dist' is given in units of km.

                  trgepc   the &quot;intercept epoch.&quot;

                           [1,1]  = size(surf(i).trgepc);
                           double = class(surf(i).trgepc)

                           This is the epoch at which the ray defined by
                           `obsrvr' and `dvec' intercepts the target
                           surface at `spoint'. `trgepc' is defined as
                           follows: letting `lt' be the one-way light time
                           between the observer and the intercept point,
                           `trgepc' is the epoch et-lt, et+lt, or `et'
                           depending on whether the requested aberration
                           correction is, respectively, for received

                           `lt' is computed using the method indicated by
                           `abcorr'.

                           `trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

                           epoch `trgepc' to the observer at epoch `et'.

                           [3,1]  = size(surf(i).obspos);
                           double = class(surf(i).obspos)

                           `obspos' is expressed in the target body-fixed
                           reference frame evaluated at `trgepc'. (This is
                           the frame relative to which `spoint' is given.)

                           `obspos' is returned to simplify various related
                           computations that would otherwise be cumbersome.
                           For example, the vector `xvec' from the observer
                           to `spoint' can be calculated via

                              xvec = spoint - obspos

                           The components of `obspos' are given in units of
                           km.

                  found    the logical flag indicating whether or not the ray
                           intersects the target.

                           [1,1]   = size(surf(i).found);
                           logical = class(surf(i).found)

                           If an intersection exists `found' will be returned
                           as true. If the ray misses the target, `found'
                           will return as false.

               `surf' return with the same vectorization measure, N, as `et'.

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) The following program computes surface intercept points on
      Mars for the boresight and FOV boundary vectors of the MGS MOC
      narrow angle camera. The intercepts are computed for a single
      observation epoch. Light time and stellar aberration
      corrections are used. For simplicity, camera distortion is
      ignored.

   A sister version of this routine exists named <a href="cspice_srfxpt.html">cspice_srfxpt</a> that returns
   the structure field data as separate arguments.

   Given a ray defined by a direction vector and the location of an
   observer, <b>mice_srfxpt</b> computes the surface intercept point of the ray
   on a specified target body. <b>mice_srfxpt</b> also determines the distance
   between the observer and the surface intercept point.

   When aberration corrections are used, this routine finds the
   value of `spoint' such that, if `spoint' is regarded as an ephemeris
   object, after the selected aberration corrections are applied to
   the vector from the observer to `spoint', the resulting vector is
   parallel to the direction vector `dvec'.

   This routine computes light time corrections using light time
   between the observer and the surface intercept point, as opposed
   to the center of the target. Similarly, stellar aberration
   corrections done by this routine are based on the direction of
   the vector from the observer to the light-time corrected
   intercept point, not to the target center. This technique avoids
   errors due to the differential between aberration corrections
   across the target body. Therefore it's valid to use aberration
   corrections with this routine even when the observer is very
   close to the intercept point, in particular when the
   observer-intercept point distance is much less than the
   observer-target center distance. It's also valid to use stellar
   aberration corrections even when the intercept point is near or
   on the limb (as may occur in occultation computations using a
   point target).

   When comparing surface intercept point computations with results
   from sources other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the
   same geometric definitions are used.

   If any of the listed errors occur, the output arguments are
   left unchanged.

   1)  If the input argument `method' is not recognized, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   2)  If `target' cannot be mapped to an ID code, the error
       SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   3)  If `obsrvr' cannot be mapped to an ID code, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If the input argument `abcorr' is invalid, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   5)  If a body-fixed reference frame associated with the target
       cannot be found, the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   6)  If `obsrvr' and `target' map to the same NAIF integer ID codes, an
       error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   7)  If frame definition data enabling the evaluation of the state
       of the target relative to the observer in target body-fixed
       coordinates have not been loaded prior to calling <a href="cspice_srfxpt.html">cspice_srfxpt</a>, an
       error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   8)  If the specified aberration correction is not recognized, an
       error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   9)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to
       calling <a href="cspice_srfxpt.html">cspice_srfxpt</a>, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when
       light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data
       must be available to propagate the states of both observer
       and target to the solar system barycenter.

   10) If the computation method has been specified as &quot;Ellipsoid&quot;
       and triaxial radii of the target body have not been loaded
       into the kernel pool prior to calling <a href="cspice_srfxpt.html">cspice_srfxpt</a>, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   11) If any of the radii of the target body are non-positive, an
       error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine. The target must be an extended body.

   12) If PCK data needed to define the target body-fixed frame have
       not been loaded prior to calling <a href="cspice_srfxpt.html">cspice_srfxpt</a>, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   13) If the reference frame designated by `dref' is not recognized
       by the SPICE frame subsystem, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   14) If the direction vector `dvec' is the zero vector, an error
       is signaled  by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   15) If any of the input arguments, `method', `target', `et',
       `abcorr', `obsrvr', `dref' or `dvec', is undefined, an error
       is signaled by the Matlab error handling system.

   16) If any of the input arguments, `method', `target', `et',
       `abcorr', `obsrvr', `dref' or `dvec', is not of the expected
       type, or it does not have the expected dimensions and size, an
       error is signaled by the Mice interface.

   Appropriate SPK, PCK, and frame kernels must be loaded by the
   calling program before this routine is called.  CK, SCLK, and
   IK kernels may be required as well.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for target and observer must be
      loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
      target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
      must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
      Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
      or more SPK files via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  PCK data: if the computation method is specified as
      &quot;Ellipsoid,&quot; triaxial radii for the target body must be
      loaded into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by
      loading a text PCK file via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must
      be loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK
      file.

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
      the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
      the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
      pool. Similarly, the frame definition required to map
      between the frame designated by `dref' and the target
      body-fixed frame must be available. Typically the
      definitions of frames not already built-in to SPICE are
      supplied by loading a frame kernel.

   The following data may be required:

   -  CK data: if the frame to which `dref' refers is fixed to a
      spacecraft instrument or structure, at least one CK file
      will be needed to permit transformation of vectors between
      that frame and both J2000 and the target body-fixed frame.

   -  SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
      kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
      (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
      (TDB).

   -  IK data: one or more I-kernels may be required to enable
      transformation of vectors from an instrument-fixed frame to
      a spacecraft-fixed frame whose attitude is given by a
      C-kernel.


   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

</pre><h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  A cautionary note: if aberration corrections are used, and if
       `dref' is the target body-fixed frame, the epoch at which that
       frame is evaluated is offset from `et' by the light time between
       the observer and the *center* of the target body. This light
       time normally will differ from the light time between the
       observer and intercept point. Consequently the orientation of
       the target body-fixed frame at `trgepc' will not match that of
       the target body-fixed frame at the epoch associated with `dref'.
       As a result, various derived quantities may not be as
       expected: for example, `obspos' would not be the inverse of the
       aberration-corrected position of the target as seen by the
       observer.

       In many applications the errors arising from this frame
       discrepancy may be insignificant; however a safe approach is
       to always use as `dref' a frame other than the target body-fixed
       frame.
