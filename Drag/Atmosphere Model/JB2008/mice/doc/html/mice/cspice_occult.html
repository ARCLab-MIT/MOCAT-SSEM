   CSPICE_OCCULT determines the occultation condition (not occulted,
   partially occulted, etc.) of one target relative to another target as
   seen by an observer at a given time.

   The surfaces of the target bodies may be represented by triaxial
   ellipsoids, points, or by topographic data provided by DSK files.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      targ1    the name of the first target body.

               [1,c1] = size(targ1); char = class(targ1)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(targ1); cell = class(targ1)

               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For example,
               both 'Moon' and '301' are accepted.

      shape1   a string indicating the geometric model used to represent the
               shape of the first target body.

               [1,c2] = size(shape1); char = class(shape1)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(shape1); cell = class(shape1)

               The supported options are:

                  'ELLIPSOID'

                      Use a triaxial ellipsoid model with radius
                      values provided via the kernel pool. A kernel
                      variable having a name of the form

                         'BODYnnn_RADII'

                      where nnn represents the NAIF integer code
                      associated with the body, must be present in
                      the kernel pool. This variable must be
                      associated with three numeric values giving the
                      lengths of the ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z
                      semi-axes.

                  'POINT'

                      Treat the body as a single point. When a point
                      target is specified, the occultation conditions
                      can only be total, annular, or none.

                  'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]'

                      Use topographic data provided by DSK files to
                      model the body's shape. These data must be
                      provided by loaded DSK files.

                      The surface list specification is optional. The
                      syntax of the list is

                         &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                      If present, it indicates that data only for the
                      listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                      need not be available for all surfaces in the
                      list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                      associated with the target body are used.

                      The surface list may contain surface names or
                      surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                      be delimited by double quotes, for example

                         SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;

                      If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                      or IDs must be separated by commas.

                      See the -Particulars section below for details
                      concerning use of DSK data.

               The combinations of the shapes of the target bodies
               `targ1' and `targ2' must be one of:

                  One ELLIPSOID, one POINT
                  Two ELLIPSOIDs
                  One DSK, one POINT

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `shape1'.

      frame1   the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference frame
               associated with the first target body.

               [1,c3] = size(frame1); char = class(frame1)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(frame1); cell = class(frame1)

               Examples of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and
               'ITRF93' (for the Earth).

               If the first target body is modeled as a point, `frame1'
               should be left blank (Ex: ' ').

               Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
               non-blank frame name are not significant in the string.

      targ2    the name of the second target body.

               [1,c4] = size(targ2); char = class(targ2)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(targ2); cell = class(targ2)

               See the description of `targ1' above for more details.

      shape2   the shape specification for the body designated by `targ2'.

               [1,c5] = size(shape2); char = class(shape2)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(shape2); cell = class(shape2)

               See the description of `shape1' above for details.

      frame2   the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference frame
               associated with the second target body.

               [1,c6] = size(frame2); char = class(frame2)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(frame2); cell = class(frame2)

               See the description of `frame1' above for more details.

      abcorr   indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to the
               state of each target body to account for one-way light time.

               [1,c7] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               Stellar aberration corrections are ignored if specified,
               since these corrections don't improve the accuracy of the
               occultation determination.

               See the header of the Mice routine <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a> for a
               detailed description of the aberration correction
               options. For convenience, the options supported by
               this routine are listed below:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction.

                  'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

               Case and blanks are not significant in the string
               `abcorr'.

      obsrvr   the name of the body from which the occultation is observed.

               [1,c8] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

               See the description of `targ1' above for more details.

      et       the observation time(s) in seconds past the J2000 epoch.

               [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)

   the call:

      [ocltid] = <b>cspice_occult</b>( targ1,  shape1, frame1,                   ...
                                targ2,  shape2, frame2,                   ...
                                abcorr, obsrvr, et      )

   returns:

      ocltid   an integer occultation code(s) indicating the geometric
               relationship of the three bodies.

               [1,n] = size(ocltid); int32 = class(ocltid)

               The meaning of the sign of `ocltid' is given below.

                   Code sign          Meaning
                   ---------          ------------------------------
                      &gt; 0             The second target is
                                      partially or fully occulted
                                      by the first.

                      &lt; 0             The first target is
                                      partially of fully
                                      occulted by the second.

                      = 0             No occultation.

               Possible `ocltid' values and meanings are given below. The
               variable names indicate the type of occultation and which
               target is in the back. For example, SPICE_OCCULT_TOTAL1
               represents a total occultation in which the first target is in
               the back of (or is occulted by) the second target.

               When the target shapes are DSK and POINT, the only
               possible occultation conditions are total, annular,
               or none.

   For many purposes, modeling extended bodies as triaxial
   ellipsoids is adequate for determining whether one body is
   occulted by another as seen from a specified observer.

   Using DSK data
   ==============

      DSK loading and unloading
      -------------------------

      DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
      calling <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="cspice_unload.html">cspice_unload</a> or
      <a href="cspice_kclear.html">cspice_kclear</a>. See the documentation of <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> for limits on
      numbers of loaded DSK files.

      For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
      loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
      use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
      example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
      used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
      used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
      the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
      that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
      given body have different surface ID codes.


      DSK data priority
      -----------------

      A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
      files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
      given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
      intervals of the segments overlap as well.

      When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
      overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
      files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
      precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
      segment located closer to the end of the file takes
      precedence.

      When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
      segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
      both represent a surface as a set of triangular plates, the
      union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
      surface.

      Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
      Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
      in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
      required in the `shape1' and `shape2' arguments.


      Syntax of the shape input arguments for the DSK case
      ----------------------------------------------------

      The keywords and surface list in the target shape arguments
      `shape1' and `shape2' are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may
      appear in any order, for example

         'DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED'
         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;'
         'UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK'

      The simplest form of the `method' argument specifying use of
      DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED'

      For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
      body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
      segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be
      the usual case.

      When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
      files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
      surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
      specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
      surfaces are to be used together.

      The surface list consists of the string

         'SURFACES = '

      followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
      identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
      string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
      names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

         Surface Name                              ID code
         ------------                              -------
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                1
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                 2
         &quot;Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;                         3

      If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
      data for surface 1 can be specified by either

         'SURFACES = 1'

      or

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;'

      Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because
      it contains blank characters.

      To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
      of the following surface lists could be used:

         'SURFACES = 2, 3'

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

         'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

      An example of a shape argument that could be constructed
      using one of the surface lists above is

         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  If the target or observer body names input by the user are
       not recognized, an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   2)  If the input shapes are not accepted, an error is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   3)  If both input shapes are points, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot
       be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel
       variable having a name of the form

          'BODYnnn_RADII'

       where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with
       the body, an error is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   5)  If any of the target or observer bodies (targ1, targ2, or
       obsrvr) are the same, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   6)  If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute any
       required state vector, an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel,
       the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   8)  If the aberration correction specification `abcorr' is invalid,
       an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   9)  If either `shape1' or `shape2' specifies that the target surface
       is represented by DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for
       the specified target, an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   10) If either `shape1' or `shape2' specifies that the target surface
       is represented by DSK data, but the shape specification is
       invalid, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   11) If any of the input arguments, `targ1', `shape1', `frame1',
       `targ2', `shape2', `frame2', `abcorr', `obsrvr' or `et', is
       undefined, an error is signaled by the Matlab error handling
       system.

   12) If any of the input arguments, `targ1', `shape1', `frame1',
       `targ2', `shape2', `frame2', `abcorr', `obsrvr' or `et', is
       not of the expected type, or it does not have the expected
       dimensions and size, an error is signaled by the Mice
       interface.

</pre><h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4><pre>

   Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
   before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data
      for the target, source and observer that cover the time
      instant specified by the argument `et'. If aberration
      corrections are used, the states of the target bodies and of
      the observer relative to the solar system barycenter must be
      calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically
      ephemeris data
      are made available by loading one or more SPK files via
      <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
      semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.
      Typically these data are made available by loading a text
      PCK file via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  FK data: if either of the reference frames designated by
      `frame1' or `frame2' are not built in to the SPICE system,
      one or more FKs specifying these frames must be loaded.

   The following data may be required:

   -  DSK data: if either `shape1' or `shape2' indicates that DSK
      data are to be used, DSK files containing topographic data
      for the target body must be loaded. If a surface list is
      specified, data for at least one of the listed surfaces must
      be loaded.

   -  Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified
      in `shape1' or `shape2', the association of these names with
      their corresponding surface ID codes must be established by
      assignments of the kernel variables

         NAIF_SURFACE_NAME
         NAIF_SURFACE_CODE
         NAIF_SURFACE_BODY

      Normally these associations are made by loading a text
      kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example
      of such a set of assignments is

         NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'
         NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1
         NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499

   -  CK data: either of the body-fixed frames to which `frame1' or
      `frame2' refer might be a CK frame. If so, at least one CK
      file will be needed to permit transformation of vectors
      between that frame and the J2000 frame.

   -  SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
      kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
      (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
      (TDB).

   Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every
   time this routine is called.
