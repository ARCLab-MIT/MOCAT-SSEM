   CSPICE_DSKW02 writes a type 2 DSK segment to a DSK file.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      handle   the DAS file handle associated with a DSK file.

               [1,1] = size(handle); int32 = class(handle)

               The file must be open for write access.

      center   the ID code of the body whose surface is described
               by the input plate model.

               [1,1] = size(center); int32 = class(center)

               `center' refers to an ephemeris object.

      surfid   the ID code of the surface described by the input
               plate model.

               [1,1] = size(surfid); int32 = class(surfid)

               Multiple surfaces (for example, surfaces having different
               resolutions) may be associated with a given body.

      dclass   the data class of the input data set.

               [1,1] = size(dclass); int32 = class(dclass)

               See the header file MiceDSK.m for values and meanings.

      frame    the name of the reference frame with respect to
               which the input data are expressed.

               [1,c1] = size(fname); char = class(fname)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(fname); cell = class(fname)

      corsys   the coordinate system in which the spatial coverage
               of the input data is expressed.

               [1,1] = size(corsys); int32 = class(corsys)

               `corsys' is an integer code. See the header file MiceDSK.m
               for values and meanings.

      corpar   an array of parameters associated with the input
               coordinate system.

               [2,1] = size(corpar); double = class(corpar)

               For latitudinal and rectangular coordinates, `corpar'
               is ignored.

               For planetodetic coordinates, the contents of `corpar'
               are:

                  Element         Contents
                  ---------       -----------------------------------
                  corpar(1)       Equatorial radius of reference
                  corpar(2)       Flattening coefficient. The polar
                                  radius of the reference spheroid
                                  is given by

                                     corpar(1) * ( 1 - corpar(2) )

      mncor1,
      mxcor1,
      mncor2,
      mxcor2,
      mncor3,
      mxcor3   respectively, lower and upper bounds of
               each of the coordinates of the input data, where the
               coordinate system is defined by `corsys' and `corpar'.

               [1,1] = size(mncor1); double = class(mncor1)
               [1,1] = size(mxcor1); double = class(mxcor1)
               [1,1] = size(mncor2); double = class(mncor2)
               [1,1] = size(mxcor2); double = class(mxcor2)
               [1,1] = size(mncor3); double = class(mncor3)
               [1,1] = size(mxcor3); double = class(mxcor3)

               These bounds define the region for which the segment
               provides data.

               Distance units are km. Angular units are radians.

               The interpretation of these bounds depends on the data
               class; see `dclass' above.

                  Single-valued surfaces
                  ----------------------

                  If the segment has data class SPICE_DSK_SVFCLS (see
                  MiceDSK.m), the segment defines a surface as a
                  single-valued function of its domain coordinates:
                  for example, it may define the radius of the
                  surface as a function of planetocentric longitude
                  and latitude.

                  In this case, the input data must cover a
                  rectangle in dimensions 1 and 2 of the input
                  coordinate system: the set of points

                     R = { (x,y): mncor1 &lt; x &lt; mxcor1;
                                  mncor2 &lt; y &lt; mxcor2  }

                  must be completely covered by the input data. In
                  other words, for each point (x,y) of R, there must
                  be some plate containing a point whose first two
                  coordinates are (x,y).

                  The plate set may extend beyond the coordinate
                  range defined by the bounds on the domain.

                  Normally for single-valued surfaces, `mncor3' and
                  `mxcor3' are the minimum and maximum values of the
                  function attained on the domain.

                  General surfaces
                  ----------------

                  If the segment has data class SPICE_DSK_GENCLS (see
                  MiceDSK.m), the segment simply contains a
                  collection of plates: no guarantees are made about the
                  topology of the surface. The coordinate bounds simply
                  indicate the spatial region for which the segment
                  provides data.

                  Note that shapes of small bodies such as asteroids
                  and comet nuclei may fall into the &quot;general
                  surface&quot; category. Surface features such as cliffs,
                  caves, and arches prevent a surface from being
                  represented as a single-valued function of latitude
                  and longitude, for example.

                  Longitude interpretation and restrictions
                  -----------------------------------------

                  The following rules apply to longitudes provided in
                  the arguments

                     mncor1
                     mxcor1

                  All angles have units of radians. The tolerance
                  SPICE_DSK_ANGMRG is used for the comparisons shown
                  below.

                     1) Longitudes must be in the range

                           -2*pi  :  2*pi

                        Values that are out of range by no more than
                        SPICE_DSK_ANGMRG are bracketed to be in range.


                     2) It is acceptable for the longitude bounds to be
                        equal or out of order. If

                           mxcor1 &lt; mncor1
                                    -

                        then either `mxcor1' is treated by the DSK
                        subsystem as though it were mxcor1 + 2*pi, or
                        `mncor1' is treated as mncor1 - 2*pi: whichever
                        shift puts the bounds in the allowed range is
                        made.

                        The input longitude bounds must not be equal.
                        If the lower bound is greater than the upper
                        bound, the difference between the bounds must
                        not be an integer multiple of 2*pi.

                        Aside from any small changes made to move the
                        input values of `mncor1' or `mxcor1' into range,
                        the values are stored in the DSK segment as is.

                     3) `mxcor1' must not exceed `mncor1' by more than 2*pi.
                        Values that are out of range by no more than
                        SPICE_DSK_ANGMRG are bracketed to be in range.

      first,
      last     the endpoints of the time interval over which this
               data set is applicable.

               [1,1] = size(first); double = class(first)
               [1,1] = size(last);  double = class(last)

               These times are expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

      vrtces   an array of coordinates of the vertices.

               [3,m] = size(vrtces); double = class(vrtces)

               The ith vertex occupies elements [1:3,i] of
               this array.

      plates   an array representing the plates of the model.

               [3,n] = size(plates); int32 = class(plates)

               The elements of `plates' are vertex indices. The vertex
               indices of the ith plate occupy elements [1:3,i] of
               this array.

      spaixd,
      spaixi   respectively, the double precision and integer
               components of the spatial index of the segment.

               [p,1] = size(spaixd); double = class(spaixd)
               [q,1] = size(spaixi); int32 = class(spaixi)

               It is strongly recommended that the helper routine
               <a href="cspice_dskmi2.html">cspice_dskmi2</a> be used to create these arrays. See the
               -Examples section below.

   the call:

      <b>cspice_dskw02</b>( handle, center, surfid, dclass, frame,               ...
                     corsys, corpar, mncor1, mxcor1, mncor2,              ...
                     mxcor2, mncor3, mxcor3, first,  last,                ...
                     vrtces, plates, spaixd, spaixi        )

   returns:

      None.

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Create a three-segment DSK file using plate model data for
      Phobos. Use latitudinal, rectangular, and planetodetic
      coordinates in the respective segments. This is not a
      realistic example, but it serves to demonstrate use of
      the supported coordinate systems.

      Use the DSK kernel below to provide, for simplicity, the input
      plate and vertex data. This file has one segment only.

   This routine writes a type 2 segment to a DSK file that has been
   opened for write access.

   Users planning to create DSK files should consider whether the
   SPICE DSK creation utility MKDSK may be suitable for their needs.

   This routine is supported by the routines <a href="cspice_dskmi2.html">cspice_dskmi2</a> and <a href="cspice_dskrb2.html">cspice_dskrb2</a>
   <a href="cspice_dskmi2.html">cspice_dskmi2</a> simplifies use of this routine by creating the &quot;spatial
   index&quot; arrays required as inputs by this routine. <a href="cspice_dskrb2.html">cspice_dskrb2</a> computes
   bounds on the third coordinate of the input plate set.

   Spatial Indexes
   ===============

   A spatial index is a group of data structures that facilitates
   rapid high-level computations involving sets of plates. The data
   structures created by this routine are aggregated into arrays
   of type SpiceInt and type SpiceDouble.


   Voxel grids
   ===========

   A key geometric computation---probably the most important, as it
   serves as a foundation for other high-level computations---is
   finding the intersection of a ray with the plate set. DSK type 2
   segments use data structures called &quot;voxel grids&quot; as part of
   their indexing mechanism. There is a &quot;coarse grid&quot;: a box that
   completely encloses a DSK type 2 segment's plate set, and which
   is composed of identically-sized cubes called &quot;coarse voxels.&quot;
   Each coarse voxel in composed of smaller cubes called &quot;fine
   voxels.&quot; When the term &quot;voxel&quot; is used without qualification, it
   refers to fine voxels.

   Type 2 DSK segments contain data structures that associate plates
   with the fine voxels intersected by those plates. These
   structures enable the type 2 DSK software to rapidly find plates
   in a given region of space.

   Voxel scales
   ============

   There are two voxel scales:

   -  The coarse voxel scale is the integer ratio of the
      edge length of a coarse voxel to the edge length of
      a fine voxel

   -  The fine voxel scale is the double precision ratio
      of the edge length of a fine voxel to the average
      extent of the plates in the input plate set. &quot;Extents&quot;
      of a plate are the absolute values of the differences
      between the respective maximum and minimum X, Y, and Z
      coordinates of the plate's vertices.

   Voxel scales determine the resolution of the voxel grid.
   Voxel scales must be chosen to satisfy size constraints and
   provide reasonable plate lookup performance.

   The following considerations apply to spatial indexes of
   type 2 DSK segments:

      1)  The maximum number of coarse voxels is fixed at
          SPICE_DSK02_MAXCGR (declared in SpiceDSK.h).

      2)  If there are too few fine voxels, the average number of
          plates per fine voxel will be very large. This largely
          negates the performance improvement afforded by having an
          index. Also, the number of plates per voxel may exceed limits
          imposed by DSK subroutines that use static arrays.

      3)  If there are too many fine voxels, the average number of
          voxels intersected by a given plate may be too large for all
          the plate-voxel associations to be stored. In addition, the
          time needed to examine the plate lists for each voxel
          (including the empty ones) may become quite large, again
          negating the value of the index.

   In many cases, voxel scales yielding optimum performance must be
   determined by experiment. However, the following heuristics can
   provide reasonable starting values:

      Let `np' be the number of plates. Let `fs' be the fine voxel
      scale. Then a reasonable value of `fs' may be

                 (0.25)
         fs =  np       / 8.

      In general, `fs' should not smaller than 1.

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  If the reference frame name `frame' could not be mapped to an ID
       code, the error SPICE(FRAMEIDNOTFOUND) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  If the segment stop time precedes the start time, the error
       SPICE(TIMESOUTOFORDER) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   3)  If an input longitude value is outside the range

          [ -2*pi - angmrg,   2*pi + angmrg ]

       the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine. Longitudes outside of the range
       by a smaller amount than `angmrg' will be truncated to lie in
       the interval [-2*pi, 2*pi].

   4)  If the absolute value of the difference between the input
       maximum longitude and the minimum longitude is more than
       2*pi+angmrg, the error SPICE(INVALIDLONEXTENT) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine. If either longitude
       bound exceeds the other by an amount between 2*pi and
       2*pi+angmrg, the larger value will be truncated to the smaller
       value plus 2*pi.

   5)  If an input latitude value is outside the range

          [ -pi/2 - angmrg,   pi/2 + angmrg ]

       the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine. Latitudes outside of the range
       by a smaller amount than `angmrg' will be truncated to lie in
       the interval [-pi/2, pi/2].

   6)  If the coordinate system is latitudinal and the lower radius
       bound is negative, or if the upper radius bound is
       non-positive, the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If the coordinate system is latitudinal or planetodetic and
       the bounds of the latitude, radius or altitude coordinate are
       out of order, the error SPICE(BOUNDSOUTOFORDER) is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   8)  If the coordinate system is latitudinal or planetodetic and
       the lower and upper bounds of the longitude, latitude, radius
       or altitude coordinate, respectively, are equal, the error
       SPICE(ZEROBOUNDSEXTENT) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine. If the lower longitude bound is greater
       than the upper bound, and if the difference between the bounds
       is an integer multiple of 2*pi, the same error is signaled.

   9)  If the coordinate system is planetodetic and the input
       equatorial radius is non-positive, the error
       SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   10) If the coordinate system is planetodetic and the input
       flattening coefficient is greater than or equal to 1, the
       error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   11) If the coordinate system is planetodetic, and if the minimum
       altitude is less than the maximum of

                  2           2
            {  -(b / a),   -(a / b)  }

       where `a' and `b' are the semi-major and semi-minor axis lengths
       of the reference ellipsoid, the error SPICE(DEGENERATESURFACE)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   12) If the coordinate system is rectangular and any coordinate
       lower bound is greater than or equal to the corresponding
       upper bound, the error SPICE(BOUNDSOUTOFORDER) is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   13) If the coordinate system code is not recognized, the error
       SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   14) If any vertex index belonging to an input plate is outside of
       the range 1:nv, where `nv' is the number of vertices, the
       error SPICE(BADVERTEXINDEX) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   15) If `nv', the number of vertices, is less than 1 or greater
       than SPICE_DSK02_MAXVRT, the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   16) If `np', the number of plates, is less than 1 or greater than
       SPICE_DSK02_MAXPLT, the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   17) If any voxel grid extent is less than 1 or greater than
       SPICE_DSK02_MAXVOX, the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   18) If the voxel count is greater than SPICE_DSK02_MAXVOX, the
       error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   19) If the coarse voxel count is less than 1 or greater than
       SPICE_DSK02_MAXCGR, the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   20) If the coarse voxel scale is less than 1 or more than the cube
       root of the fine voxel count, the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   21) If the cube of the coarse voxel scale does not divide the
       fine voxel count evenly, the error SPICE(INCOMPATIBLESCALE)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   22) If the input data class is not recognized, the error
       SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   23) If an error occurs while writing the segment to the output
       DSK file, the error is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   24) If any of the input arguments, `handle', `center', `surfid',
       `dclass', `frame', `corsys', `corpar', `mncor1', `mxcor1',
       `mncor2', `mxcor2', `mncor3', `mxcor3', `first', `last',
       `vrtces', `plates', `spaixd' or `spaixi', is undefined, an
       error is signaled by the Matlab error handling system.

   25) If any of the input arguments, `handle', `center', `surfid',
       `dclass', `frame', `corsys', `corpar', `mncor1', `mxcor1',
       `mncor2', `mxcor2', `mncor3', `mxcor3', `first', `last',
       `vrtces', `plates', `spaixd' or `spaixi', is not of the
       expected type, or it does not have the expected dimensions and
       size, an error is signaled by the Mice interface.
