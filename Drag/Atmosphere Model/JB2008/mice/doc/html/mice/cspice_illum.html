   Deprecated: This routine has been superseded by the Mice routine
   <a href="cspice_ilumin.html">cspice_ilumin</a>. This routine is supported for purposes of
   backward compatibility only.

   CSPICE_ILLUM calculates the illumination angles at a specified
   surface point of a target body.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      target   the name of the target body.

               [1,c1] = size(target); char = class(target)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

               `target' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for the
               object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate
               strings that indicate the moon is the target body.

      et       the epoch(s), specified in ephemeris seconds past J2000, at
               which the apparent illumination angles at the specified
               surface point on the target body, as seen from the observing
               body, are to be computed.

               [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)

      abcorr   the aberration correction to be used in computing the
               location and orientation of the target body and the location
               of the Sun.

               [1,c2] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               Possible values are:

                  'NONE'        No aberration correction.

                  'LT'          Correct the position and
                                orientation of target body for
                                light time, and correct the
                                position of the Sun for light
                                time.

                  'LT+S'        Correct the observer-target vector
                                for light time and stellar
                                aberration, correct the
                                orientation of the target body
                                for light time, and correct the
                                target-Sun vector for light time
                                and stellar aberration.

                  'CN'          Converged Newtonian light time
                                correction. In solving the light
                                time equation, the 'CN'
                                correction iterates until the
                                solution converges (three
                                iterations on all supported
                                platforms). Whether the 'CN+S'
                                solution is substantially more
                                accurate than the 'LT' solution
                                depends on the geometry of the
                                participating objects and on the
                                accuracy of the input data. In
                                all cases this routine will
                                execute more slowly when a
                                converged solution is computed.
                                See the -Particulars section of
                                <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a> for a discussion of
                                precision of light time
                                corrections.

                                Both the state and rotation of
                                the target body are corrected for
                                light time.

                     'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                                correction and stellar aberration
                                correction.

                                Both the state and rotation of
                                the target body are corrected for
                                light time.

      obsrvr   the name of the observing body, typically a spacecraft, the
               earth, or a surface point on the earth.

               [1,c3] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

               `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you may
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for the
               object. For example both 'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate
               strings that indicate the earth is the observer.

               `obsrvr' may be not be identical to `target'.

      spoint   an array representing a surface point or points on the target
               body, expressed in rectangular body-fixed (body equator and
               prime meridian) coordinates.

               [3,n] = size(spoint); double = class(spoint)

               Each `spoint' element (spoint(:,i)) corresponds to the same
               element index in `et' (et(i)) and need not be visible from the
               observer's location at time `et'.

               Note: The design of <b>cspice_illum</b> supposes the input 'spoint'
               originates as the output of another Mice routine. Still, in
               the event the user requires an 'spoint' constant over a vector
               of 'et', such as a constant station location at (x,y,z),
               construct 'spoint' with the MATLAB code:

                  N            = numel(et);
                  spoint       = eye(3, N);
                  spoint(1,:)  = x;
                  spoint(2,:)  = y;
                  spoint(3,:)  = z;

   the call:

      [phase, solar, emissn] = <b>cspice_illum</b>( target, et,    abcorr,       ...
                                             obsrvr, spoint        )

   returns:

      phase    the phase angle(s) at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr' at time
               `et'.

               [1,n] = size(phase); double = class(phase)

               This is the angle between the spoint-obsrvr vector and the
               spoint-Sun vector. Units are radians. The range of `phase' is
               [0, pi]. See -Particulars below for a detailed discussion of
               the definition.

      solar    the solar incidence angle(s) at `spoint', as seen from
               `obsrvr' at time `et'.

               [1,n] = size(solar); double = class(solar)

               This is the angle between the surface normal vector at
               `spoint' and the spoint-Sun vector. Units are radians. The
               range of `solar' is [0, pi]. See -Particulars below for a
               detailed discussion of the definition.

      emissn   the emission angle(s) at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr' at
               time `et'.

               [1,n] = size(emissn); double = class(emissn)

               This is the angle between the surface normal vector at
               `spoint' and the spoint-observer vector. Units are radians.
               The range of `emissn' is [0, pi]. See -Particulars below for
               a detailed discussion of the definition.

               `phase', `solar' and `emissn' return with the same
               vectorization measure, N, as `et' and `spoint'.

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   The term &quot;illumination angles&quot; refers to following set of
   angles:


      solar incidence angle    Angle between the surface normal at
                               the specified surface point and the
                               vector from the surface point to the
                               `sun'.

      emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at
                               the specified surface point and the
                               vector from the surface point to the
                               observer.

      phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the
                               surface point to the observing body's
                               location and from the surface point
                               to the `sun'.


   The diagram below illustrates the geometrical relationships
   defining these angles. The labels for the solar incidence,
   emission, and phase angles are &quot;s.i.&quot;, &quot;e.&quot;, and &quot;phase&quot;.

    (observer)         location


   Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector
   at the surface point, and the target-sun vector are coplanar,
   then phase is the sum of incidence and emission. This is rarely
   true; usually

      phase angle  &lt;  solar incidence angle + emission angle

   All of the above angles can be computed using light time
   corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or
   no aberration corrections. The way aberration corrections
   are used is described below.

   Care must be used in computing light time corrections. The
   guiding principle used here is &quot;describe what appears in
   an image.&quot; We ignore differential light time; the light times
   from all points on the target to the observer are presumed to be
   equal.


      Observer-target body vector
      ---------------------------

      Let `et' be the epoch at which an observation or remote
      sensing measurement is made, and let et - lt (&quot;LT&quot; stands
      for &quot;light time&quot;) be the epoch at which the photons received
      at `et' were emitted from the body (we use the term &quot;emitted&quot;
      loosely here).

      The correct observer-target vector points from the observer's
      location at `et' to the target body's location at et - lt.
      The target-observer vector points in the opposite direction.

      Since light time corrections are not symmetric, the correct
      target-observer vector CANNOT be found by computing the light
      time corrected position of the observer as seen from the
      target body.


      Target body's orientation
      -------------------------

      Using the definitions of `et' and `lt' above, the target
      body's orientation at et - lt is used. The surface
      normal is dependent on the target body's orientation, so
      the body's orientation model must be evaluated for the correct
      epoch.


      Target body -- `sun' vector
      ---------------------------

      All surface features on the target body will appear in
      a measurement made at `et' as they were at et-lt. In
      particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on
      the apparent location of the `sun' as seen from the target
      body at et-lt. So, a second light time correction is used
      in finding the apparent location of the `sun'.


   Stellar aberration corrections, when used, are applied as follows:


      Observer-target body vector
      ---------------------------

      In addition to light time correction, stellar aberration is
      used in computing the apparent target body position as seen
      from the observer's location at time `et'. This apparent
      position defines the observer-target body vector.


      Target body-Sun vector
      ----------------------

      The target body-Sun vector is the apparent position of the `sun',
      corrected for light time and stellar aberration, as seen from
      the target body at time et-lt. Note that the target body's
      position is not affected by the stellar aberration correction
      applied in finding its apparent position as seen by the
      observer.


   Once all of the vectors, as well as the target body's
   orientation, have been computed with the proper aberration
   corrections, the element of time is eliminated from the
   computation. The problem becomes a purely geometrical one,
   and is described by the diagram above.

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  If `target' and `obsrvr' are not distinct, the error
       SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   2)  If no SPK (ephemeris) data are available for the observer,
       target, and Sun at the time specified by `et', an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If
       light time corrections are used, SPK data for the target body
       must be available at the time et - lt, where `lt' is the one-way
       light time from the target to the observer at `et'.
       Additionally, SPK data must be available for the Sun at the
       time et - lt - lt2, where `lt2' is the light time from the Sun
       to the target body at time et - lt.

   3)  If PCK data defining the orientation or shape of the target
       body are unavailable, an error is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   4)  If no body-fixed frame is associated with the target body, the
       error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   5)  If name of target or observer cannot be translated to its NAIF
       ID code, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   6)  If radii for `target' are not found in the kernel pool, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If the size of the `target' body radii kernel variable is not
       three, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   8)  If any of the three `target' body radii is less-than or equal to
       zero, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   9)  If any of the input arguments, `target', `et', `abcorr',
       `obsrvr' or `spoint', is undefined, an error is signaled by
       the Matlab error handling system.

   10) If any of the input arguments, `target', `et', `abcorr',
       `obsrvr' or `spoint', is not of the expected type, or it does
       not have the expected dimensions and size, an error is
       signaled by the Mice interface.

   11) If the input vectorizable arguments `et' and `spoint' do not
       have the same measure of vectorization (N), an error is
       signaled by the Mice interface.
