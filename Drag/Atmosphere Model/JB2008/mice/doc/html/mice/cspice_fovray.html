   CSPICE_FOVRAY determines if a specified ray is within the field-of-view
   (FOV) of a specified instrument at a given time.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      inst     indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
               spacecraft-mounted framing camera.

               [1,c1] = size(inst); char = class(inst)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(inst); cell = class(inst)

               The field of view (FOV) of the instrument will be used to
               determine if the direction from the observer to a target,
               represented as a ray, is visible with respect to the
               instrument.

               The position of the instrument `inst' is considered to
               coincide with that of the ephemeris object `obsrvr' (see
               description below).

               The size of the instrument's FOV is constrained by the
               following: There must be a vector A such that all of
               the instrument's FOV boundary vectors have an angular
               separation from A of less than (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians
               (see description below). For FOVs that are circular or
               elliptical, the vector A is the boresight. For FOVs
               that are rectangular or polygonal, the vector A is
               calculated.

               See the header of the Mice routine <a href="cspice_getfov.html">cspice_getfov</a> for a
               description of the required parameters associated with
               an instrument.

               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
               example, both 'CASSINI_ISS_NAC' and '-82360' are
               accepted. Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string.

      raydir   the direction vector defining a ray of interest.

               [3,1] = size(raydir), double = class(raydir)

               The ray emanates from the location of the ephemeris
               object designated by the input argument `obsrvr' and
               is expressed relative to the reference frame designated
               by `rframe' (see description below).

      rframe   the name of the reference frame associated with
               the input ray's direction vector `raydir'.

               [1,c2] = size(rframe), char = class(rframe)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(rframe); cell = class(rframe)

               Note: `rframe' does not need to be the instrument's reference
               frame.

               Since light time corrections are not supported for
               rays, the orientation of the frame is always evaluated
               at the epoch associated with the observer, as opposed
               to the epoch associated with the light-time corrected
               position of the frame center.

               Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
               in the string.

      abcorr   indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
               when computing the ray's direction.

               [1,c3] = size(abcorr), char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               The supported aberration correction options are:

                  'NONE'          No correction.
                  'S'             Stellar aberration correction,
                                  reception case.
                  'XS'            Stellar aberration correction,
                                  transmission case.

               For detailed information, see the geometry finder
               required reading, gf.req.

               Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
               in the string.

      obsrvr   the name of the body from which the target
               represented by `raydir' is observed.

               [1,c4] = size(obsrvr), char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

               The instrument designated by `inst' is treated as if it were
               co-located with the observer.

               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
               example, both 'CASSINI' and '-82' are accepted. Case
               and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in
               the string.

      et       the observation time(s) in seconds past the J2000
               epoch.

               [1,n] = size(et), double = class(et)

   the call:

      [visibl] = <b>cspice_fovray</b>( inst, raydir, rframe, abcorr, obsrvr, et )

   returns:

      visibl   true if the ray is &quot;visible&quot;, or in the
               field-of-view, of `inst' at the time `et'.

               [1,n] = size(visibl), logical = class(visibl)

               Otherwise, `visibl' is false.

               `visibl' returns with the same vectorization measure, N,
               as `et'.

   SPICE_GF_MAXVRT

               is the maximum number of vertices that may be used
               to define the boundary of the specified instrument's
               field of view.

   SPICE_GF_MARGIN

               is a small positive number used to constrain the
               orientation of the boundary vectors of polygonal
               FOVs. Such FOVs must satisfy the following constraints:

                  1)  The boundary vectors must be contained
                      within a right circular cone of angular radius
                      less than than (pi/2) - SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians;
                      in other words, there must be a vector A such
                      that all boundary vectors have angular
                      separation from A of less than
                      (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians.

                  2)  There must be a pair of boundary vectors U,
                      V such that all other boundary vectors lie in
                      the same half space bounded by the plane
                      containing U and V. Furthermore, all other
                      boundary vectors must have orthogonal
                      projections onto a specific plane normal to this
                      plane (the normal plane contains the angle
                      bisector defined by U and V) such that the
                      projections have angular separation of at least
                      2*SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians from the plane spanned
                      by U and V.

               SPICE_GF_MARGIN is currently set to 1.e-12.

   See Mice header file MiceGF.m for declarations and descriptions of
   parameters used throughout the GF system.

   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.


   1) The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS)
      has been used to measure variations in starlight as
      rings and moons occult Cassini's view of the stars.
      One of these events happened at 2008-054T21:31:55.158 UTC.

   To treat the target as an ephemeris object rather than a ray, use
   the higher-level Mice routine <a href="cspice_fovtrg.html">cspice_fovtrg</a>. <a href="cspice_fovtrg.html">cspice_fovtrg</a> may be used to
   determine if ephemeris objects such as Saturn are visible in an
   instrument's FOV at a given time.

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  If the observer's name cannot be mapped to a NAIF ID code, the
       error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   2)  If the aberration correction flag calls for light time
       correction, the error SPICE(INVALIDOPTION) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   3)  If the ray's direction vector is zero, the error
       SPICE(ZEROVECTOR) is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   4)  If the instrument name `inst' does not have corresponding NAIF
       ID code, an error is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   5)  If the FOV parameters of the instrument are not present in
       the kernel pool, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   6)  If the FOV boundary has more than SPICE_GF_MAXVRT vertices, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   7)  If the instrument FOV shape is a polygon or rectangle, and
       this routine cannot find a ray R emanating from the FOV vertex
       such that maximum angular separation of R and any FOV boundary
       vector is within the limit (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine. If the
       FOV is any other shape, the same error check will be applied
       with the instrument boresight vector serving the role of R.

   8)  If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute a
       requested state vector, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   9)  If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
       the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   10) If any of the input arguments, `inst', `raydir', `rframe',
       `abcorr', `obsrvr' or `et', is undefined, an error is signaled
       by the Matlab error handling system.

   11) If any of the input arguments, `inst', `raydir', `rframe',
       `abcorr', `obsrvr' or `et', is not of the expected type, or it
       does not have the expected dimensions and size, an error is
       signaled by the Mice interface.

   Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
   before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for the observer at the time
      `et'. If aberration corrections are used, the state of the
      observer relative to the solar system barycenter
      must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.

   -  Data defining the reference frame in which the instrument's
      FOV is defined must be available in the kernel pool.
      Additionally the name `inst' must be associated with an ID
      code.

   -  IK data: the kernel pool must contain data such that
      the Mice routine <a href="cspice_getfov.html">cspice_getfov</a> may be called to obtain
      parameters for `inst'.

   The following data may be required:

   -  CK data: if the frame in which the instrument's FOV is
      defined is fixed to a spacecraft, at least one CK file will
      be needed to permit transformation of vectors between that
      frame and the J2000 frame.

   -  SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
      kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
      (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
      (TDB).

   -  Since the input ray direction may be expressed in any
      frame, additional FKs, CKs, SCLK kernels, PCKs, and SPKs
      may be required to map the direction to the J2000 frame.

   Kernel data are normally loaded via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> once per program run,
   NOT every time this routine is called.

   -Mice Version 1.1.0, 24-AUG-2021 (EDW) (JDR)

       Changed the argument names &quot;instrument&quot;, &quot;ray_frame&quot;, &quot;observer&quot;
       and &quot;visible&quot; to &quot;inst&quot;, &quot;rframe&quot;, &quot;obsrvr&quot; and &quot;visibl&quot; for
       consistency with other routines.

       Added square brackets to output argument.

       Added -Parameters, -Exceptions, -Files, -Restrictions,
       -Literature_References and -Author_and_Institution sections. Corrected
       the value and changed the name of the parameter &quot;MARGIN&quot; to
       &quot;SPICE_GF_MARGIN&quot;.

       Edited the header to comply with NAIF standard. Completed the
       list of required readings.

       Eliminated use of &quot;lasterror&quot; in rethrow.

       Removed reference to the function's corresponding CSPICE header from
       -Required_Reading section.

   -Mice Version 1.0.1, 13-APR-2015 (EDW)

       Edit to correct typos in &quot;Usage&quot; string.

   -Mice Version 1.0.0, 13-NOV-2013 (SCK) (EDW)
