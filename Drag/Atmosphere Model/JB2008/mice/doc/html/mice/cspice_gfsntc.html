   CSPICE_GFSNTC determines time intervals for which a coordinate of
   an surface intercept position vector satisfies a numerical constraint.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      target   the name of the target body.

               [1,c1] = size(target); char = class(target)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

               Optionally, you may supply the integer ID code for the object
               as an integer string. For example both 'MOON' and '301'
               are legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
               target body.

               On calling <b>cspice_gfsntc</b>, the kernel pool must contain the
               radii data corresponding to `target'.

      fixref   the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference frame
               associated with the target body `target'.

               [1,c2] = size(fixref); char = class(fixref)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(fixref); cell = class(fixref)

               The SPICE frame subsystem must recognize the `fixref' name.

      method   the name of the method to use for the surface intercept
               calculation.

               [1,c3] = size(method); char = class(method)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(method); cell = class(method)

               The accepted values for method:

                  'Ellipsoid'        The intercept computation uses
                                     a triaxial ellipsoid to model
                                     the surface of the target body.
                                     The ellipsoid's radii must be
                                     available in the kernel pool.

               The `method' string lacks sensitivity to case, and to leading
               and trailing blanks.

      abcorr   describes the aberration corrections to apply to the state
               evaluations to account for one-way light time and stellar
               aberration.

               [1,c4] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               This routine accepts the same aberration corrections as does
               the routine <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a>. See the header of <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a> for
               a detailed description of the aberration correction options.
               For convenience, the options are listed below:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction.

                  'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'LT+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'CN+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

                  'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

               The `abcorr' string lacks sensitivity to case, and to
               embedded, leading and trailing blanks.

      obsrvr   the name of the observing body.

               [1,c5] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

               Optionally, you may supply the ID code of the object as an
               integer string. For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are
               legitimate strings to supply to indicate the observer
               is the Earth.

      dref     the name of the reference frame corresponding to `dvec'.

               [1,c6] = size(dref); char = class(dref)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(dref); cell = class(dref)

               The `dref' string lacks sensitivity to case, and to leading
               and trailing blanks.

      dvec     the pointing or boresight 3-vector from the observer.

               [3,1] = size(dvec); double = class(dvec)

               The intercept of this vector and `target' is the event of
               interest.

      crdsys   the name of the coordinate system for which the
               coordinate of interest is a member.

               [1,c7] = size(crdsys); char = class(crdsys)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(crdsys); cell = class(crdsys)

      coord    the name of the coordinate of interest in `crdsys'.

               [1,c8] = size(coord); char = class(coord)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(coord); cell = class(coord)

               The supported coordinate systems and coordinate names are:

                   crdsys              coord                Range
                  ------------------  -------------------  -----------

                                       'ALTITUDE'

               The ALTITUDE coordinates have a constant value
               of zero +/- roundoff for ellipsoid targets.

               Limit searches for coordinate events in the GEODETIC and
               PLANETOGRAPHIC coordinate systems to `target' bodies with
               axial symmetry in the equatorial plane, i.e. equality
               of the body X and Y radii (oblate or prolate spheroids).

      relate   the constraint relational operator on the selected coordinate
               of the surface intercept vector.

               [1,c9] = size(relate); char = class(relate)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(relate); cell = class(relate)

               The result window found by this routine indicates the time
               intervals where the constraint is satisfied.

               Supported values of `relate' and corresponding meanings are
               shown below:

                  '&gt;'       Separation is greater than the reference
                            value `refval'.

                  '='       Separation is equal to the reference
                            value `refval'.

                  '&lt;'       Separation is less than the reference
                            value `refval'.

                  'ABSMAX'  Separation is at an absolute maximum.

                  'ABSMIN'  Separation is at an absolute  minimum.

                  'LOCMAX'  Separation is at a local maximum.

                  'LOCMIN'  Separation is at a local minimum.

               The caller may indicate that the region of interest
               is the set of time intervals where the quantity is
               within a specified measure of an absolute extremum.
               The argument `adjust' (described below) is used to
               specify this measure.

               Local extrema are considered to exist only in the
               interiors of the intervals comprising the confinement
               window: a local extremum cannot exist at a boundary
               point of the confinement window.

               The `relate' string lacks sensitivity to case, and to leading
               and trailing blanks.

      refval   reference value used together with `relate' argument to define
               an equality or inequality to satisfy by the selected
               coordinate of the surface intercept vector.

               [1,1] = size(refval); double = class(refval)

               See the discussion of `relate' above for further information.

               The units of `refval' correspond to the type as defined
               by `coord', radians for angular measures, kilometers for
               distance measures.

      adjust   value used to modify searches for absolute extrema.

               [1,1] = size(adjust); double = class(adjust)

               When `relate' is set to 'ABSMAX' or 'ABSMIN' and `adjust' is
               set to a positive value, <b>cspice_gfsntc</b> finds times when the
               surface intercept vector coordinate is within `adjust'
               radians/kilometers of the specified extreme value.

               For `relate' set to 'ABSMAX', the `result' window contains
               time intervals when the surface intercept vector coordinate
               has values between ABSMAX - adjust and ABSMAX.

               For `relate' set to 'ABSMIN', the `result' window contains
               time intervals when the surface intercept vector coordinate
               has values between ABSMIN and ABSMIN + adjust.

               `adjust' is not used for searches for local extrema,
               equality or inequality conditions.

      step     time step size to use in the search.

               [1,1] = size(adjust); double = class(adjust)

               Selection of the time step for surface intercept geometry
               requires consideration of the mechanics of a surface intercept
               event. In most cases, two distinct searches will be needed,
               one to determine the windows when the boresight vector
               intercepts the surface and then the search based on the user
               defined constraints within those windows. The boresight of
               nadir pointing instrument may continually intercept a body,
               but an instrument scanning across a disc will have
               configurations when the boresight does not intercept the body.

               The step size must be smaller than the shortest interval
               within the confinement window over which the intercept exists
               and also smaller than the shortest interval over which the
               intercept does not exist.

               For coordinates other than LONGITUDE and RIGHT ASCENSION,
               the step size must be shorter than the shortest interval,
               within the confinement window, over which the coordinate
               is monotone increasing or decreasing.

               For LONGITUDE and RIGHT ASCENSION, the step size must
               be shorter than the shortest interval, within the
               confinement window, over which either the sine or cosine
               of the coordinate is monotone increasing or decreasing.

               The choice of `step' affects the completeness but not
               the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
               precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
               See the discussion of the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL for
               details.

               `step' has units of TDB seconds.

      nintvls  value specifying the number of intervals in the internal
               workspace array used by this routine.

               [1,1] = size(nintvls); int32 = class(nintvls)

               `nintvls' should be at least as large as the number of
               intervals within the search region on which the specified
               observer-target vector coordinate function is monotone
               increasing or decreasing. It does no harm to pick a value
               of `nintvls' larger than the minimum required to execute
               the specified search, but if chosen too small, the search
               will fail.

      cnfine   a SPICE window that confines the time period over which the
               specified search is conducted.

               [2m,1] = size(cnfine); double = class(cnfine)

               `cnfine' may consist of a single interval or a collection of
               intervals.

               In some cases the confinement window can be used to
               greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
               for the desired solution. See the -Particulars section
               below for further discussion.

               See the -Examples section below for a code example
               that shows how to create a confinement window.

               In some cases the observer's state may be computed at
               times outside of `cnfine' by as much as 2 seconds. See
               -Particulars for details.

   the call:

      [result] = <b>cspice_gfsntc</b>( target, fixref, method, abcorr,  obsrvr,  ...
                                dref,   dvec,   crdsys, coord,   relate,  ...
                                refval, adjust, step,   nintvls, cnfine )

   returns:

      result   the SPICE window of intervals, contained within the
               confinement window `cnfine', on which the specified
               constraint is satisfied.

               [2n,1] = size(result); double = class(result)

               The endpoints of the time intervals comprising `result'
               are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.

               If the search is for local extrema, or for absolute
               extrema with `adjust' set to zero, then normally each
               interval of `result' will be a singleton: the left and
               right endpoints of each interval will be identical.

               If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
               constraint, `result' will return with cardinality zero.

   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL

               is the convergence tolerance used for finding
               endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
               window. SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is used to determine when
               binary searches for roots should terminate: when a
               root is bracketed within an interval of length
               SPICE_GF_CNVTOL, the root is considered to have
               been found.

               The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
               by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
               data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
               inferior to their precision.

   Any numerical results shown for these examples may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

      the IAU_EARTH frame lies within a geodetic latitude-longitude

         16 degrees &lt;= latitude  &lt;= 17 degrees

      This problem requires four searches, each search on one of the
      box restrictions. The user needs also realize the temporal behavior
      of latitude greatly differs from that of the longitude. The
      the intercept latitude varies between approximately 23.44 degrees
      and -23.44 degrees during the year. The intercept longitude varies

   This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
   within the confinement window when the selected coordinate of
   the surface intercept position vector satisfies a caller-specified
   constraint. The resulting set of intervals is returned as a SPICE
   window.

   Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
   solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
   use of this routine in user applications.


   The Search Process
   ==================

   Regardless of the type of constraint selected by the caller, this
   routine starts the search for solutions by determining the time
   periods, within the confinement window, over which the specified
   coordinate function is monotone increasing and monotone
   decreasing. Each of these time periods is represented by a SPICE
   window. Having found these windows, all of the coordinate
   function's local extrema within the confinement window are known.
   Absolute extrema then can be found very easily.

   Within any interval of these &quot;monotone&quot; windows, there will be at
   most one solution of any equality constraint. Since the boundary
   of the solution set for any inequality constraint is contained in
   the union of

   -  the set of points where an equality constraint is met

   -  the boundary points of the confinement window

   the solutions of both equality and inequality constraints can be
   found easily once the monotone windows have been found.


   Step Size
   =========

   The monotone windows (described above) are found using a two-step
   search process. Each interval of the confinement window is
   searched as follows: first, the input step size is used to
   determine the time separation at which the sign of the rate of
   change of coordinate will be sampled. Starting at
   the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be taken at each
   step. If a change of sign is found, a root has been bracketed; at
   that point, the time at which the time derivative of the
   coordinate is zero can be found by a refinement process, for
   example, using a binary search.

   Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
   of the intervals over which the coordinate function is monotone:
   the step size should be shorter than the shortest of these
   intervals (within the confinement window).

   The optimal step size is *not* necessarily related to the lengths
   of the intervals comprising the result window. For example, if
   the shortest monotone interval has length 10 days, and if the
   shortest result window interval has length 5 minutes, a step size
   of 9.9 days is still adequate to find all of the intervals in the
   result window. In situations like this, the technique of using
   monotone windows yields a dramatic efficiency improvement over a
   state-based search that simply tests at each step whether the
   specified constraint is satisfied. The latter type of search can
   miss solution intervals if the step size is longer than the
   shortest solution interval.

   Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the target and
   observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
   In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
   picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
   time.

   Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
   the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
   That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


   Convergence Tolerance
   =====================

   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
   narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
   This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
   has been determined to within an error margin called the
   &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The default convergence tolerance
   used by this routine is set by the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL (defined
   in MiceGF.m).

   The value of SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
   tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
   solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
   data will be the limiting factor.

   The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a>, e.g.

      <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a>( tolerance value );

   Call <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
   searches will use the updated tolerance value.

   Setting the tolerance tighter than SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is unlikely to be
   useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
   Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
   since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
   cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
   on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


   The Confinement Window
   ======================

   The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
   interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
   confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
   more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
   to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
   slow search of interest must be performed.

   Practical use of the coordinate search capability would likely
   consist of searches over multiple coordinate constraints to find
   time intervals that satisfies the constraints. An
   effective technique to accomplish such a search is
   to use the result window from one search as the confinement window
   of the next.

   Certain types of searches require the state of the observer,
   relative to the solar system barycenter, to be computed at times
   slightly outside the confinement window `cnfine'. The time window
   that is actually used is the result of &quot;expanding&quot; `cnfine' by a
   specified amount &quot;T&quot;: each time interval of `cnfine' is expanded by
   shifting the interval's left endpoint to the left and the right
   endpoint to the right by T seconds. Any overlapping intervals are
   merged. (The input argument `cnfine' is not modified.)

   The window expansions listed below are additive: if both
   conditions apply, the window expansion amount is the sum of the
   individual amounts.

   -  If a search uses an equality constraint, the time window
      over which the state of the observer is computed is expanded
      by 1 second at both ends of all of the time intervals
      comprising the window over which the search is conducted.

   -  If a search uses stellar aberration corrections, the time
      window over which the state of the observer is computed is
      expanded as described above.

   When light time corrections are used, expansion of the search
   window also affects the set of times at which the light time-
   corrected state of the target is computed.

   In addition to the possible 2 second expansion of the search
   window that occurs when both an equality constraint and stellar
   aberration corrections are used, round-off error should be taken
   into account when the need for data availability is analyzed.

   Longitude and Right Ascension
   =============================

   The cyclic nature of the longitude and right ascension coordinates
   produces branch cuts at +/- 180 degrees longitude and 0-360
   longitude. Round-off error may cause solutions near these branches
   to cross the branch. Use of the Mice routine <a href="cspice_wncond.html">cspice_wncond</a> will contract
   solution windows by some epsilon, reducing the measure of the
   windows and eliminating the branch crossing. A one millisecond
   contraction will in most cases eliminate numerical round-off
   caused branch crossings.

   1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
       the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
       Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
       roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
       to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
       roots.

       This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
       that if the step size is non-positive, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

          - truncation error in time values
          - finite tolerance value
          - errors in computed geometric quantities

       it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
       satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
       `result' window. One technique to handle such a situation,
       slightly contract `result' using the window routine <a href="cspice_wncond.html">cspice_wncond</a>.

   3)  If the output SPICE window `result' has insufficient capacity
       to contain the number of intervals on which the specified
       distance condition is met, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs during
       window arithmetic, the error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   5)  If the relational operator `relate' is not recognized, an
       error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   6)  If the aberration correction specifier contains an
       unrecognized value, an error is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   7)  If `adjust' is negative, an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   8)  If either of the input body names do not map to NAIF ID
       codes, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   9)  If required ephemerides or other kernel data are not
       available, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   10) If the search uses GEODETIC or PLANETOGRAPHIC coordinates, and
       the center body of the reference frame has unequal equatorial
       radii, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   11) If any of the input arguments, `target', `fixref', `method',
       `abcorr', `obsrvr', `dref', `dvec', `crdsys', `coord',
       `relate', `refval', `adjust', `step', `nintvls' or `cnfine',
       is undefined, an error is signaled by the Matlab error
       handling system.

   12) If any of the input arguments, `target', `fixref', `method',
       `abcorr', `obsrvr', `dref', `dvec', `crdsys', `coord',
       `relate', `refval', `adjust', `step', `nintvls' or `cnfine',
       is not of the expected type, or it does not have the expected
       dimensions and size, an error is signaled by the Mice
       interface.

</pre><h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4><pre>

   Appropriate SPK and PCK kernels must be loaded by the calling
   program before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data
      for the targets, observer, and any intermediate objects in
      a chain connecting the targets and observer that cover the
      time period specified by the window `cnfine'. If aberration
      corrections are used, the states of target and observer
      relative to the solar system barycenter must be calculable
      from the available ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data
      are made available by loading one or more SPK files using
      <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
      semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.
      Typically these data are made available by loading a text
      PCK file using <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  If non-inertial reference frames are used, then PCK
      files, frame kernels, C-kernels, and SCLK kernels may be
      needed.

   -  In some cases the observer's state may be computed at times
      outside of `cnfine' by as much as 2 seconds; data required to
      compute this state must be provided by loaded kernels. See
      -Particulars for details.

   Such kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT
   every time this routine is called.

</pre><h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  The kernel files to be used by this routine must be loaded
       (normally using the Mice routine <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>) before this
       routine is called.

   2)  This routine has the side effect of re-initializing the
       coordinate quantity utility package. Callers may
       need to re-initialize the package after calling this routine.
