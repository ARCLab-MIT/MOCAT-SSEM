   CSPICE_SPKPOS returns the position of a target body relative to an
   observing body, optionally corrected for light time (planetary
   aberration) and stellar aberration.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      targ     the name of a target body.

               [1,c1] = size(targ); char = class(targ)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(targ); cell = class(targ)

               Optionally, you may supply the integer ID code for the
               object as an integer string. For example both 'MOON' and
               '301' are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
               target body.

               The target and observer define a position vector
               which points from the observer to the target.

      et       the ephemeris time(s), expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB, at
               which the position of the target body relative to the
               observer is to be computed.

               [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)

               `et' refers to time at the observer's location.

      ref      the name of the reference frame relative to which the output
               position vector should be expressed.

               [1,c2] = size(ref); char = class(ref)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(ref); cell = class(ref)

               This may be any frame supported by the SPICE system,
               including built-in frames (documented in the Frames Required
               Reading) and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK).

               When `ref' designates a non-inertial frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch
               dependent on the selected aberration correction. See
               the description of the output position vector `ptarg'
               for details.

      abcorr   indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to the
               position of the target body to account for one-way light time
               and stellar aberration.

               [1,c3] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               See the discussion in the -Particulars section for
               recommendations on how to choose aberration corrections.

               `abcorr' may be any of the following:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric position of the target body
                             relative to the observer.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at `et':

                  'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the position of the target at
                             the moment it emitted photons arriving
                             at the observer at `et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation (see -Particulars for details).
                             The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                             uses one iteration.

                  'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             position obtained with the 'LT' option
                             to account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent
                             position of the target---the position
                             as seen by the observer.

                  'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                             until the solution converges (three
                             iterations on all supported platforms).
                             Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                             substantially more accurate than the
                             'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                             of the participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed. See the -Particulars section
                             below for a discussion of precision of
                             light time corrections.

                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction and stellar aberration
                             correction.


               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             position of the target at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                  'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             position obtained with the 'XLT' option
                             to account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The computed target
                             position indicates the direction that
                             photons emitted from the observer's
                             location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to hit the
                             target.

                  'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction and
                             stellar aberration correction.


               Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
               accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
               by this routine.

               Case and blanks are not significant in the string
               `abcorr'.

      obs      the name of an observing body.

               [1,c4] = size(obs); char = class(obs)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obs); cell = class(obs)

               Optionally, you may supply the ID code of the object as an
               integer string. For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are
               legitimate strings to supply to indicate the observer is
               Earth.

   the call:

      [ptarg, lt] = <b>cspice_spkpos</b>( targ, et, ref, abcorr, obs )

   returns:

      ptarg    a Cartesian 3-vector(s) representing the position of the
               target body relative to the specified observer.

               [3,n] = size(ptarg); double = class(ptarg)

               `ptarg' is corrected for the specified aberrations, and is
               expressed with respect to the reference frame specified by
               `ref'. The three components of `ptarg' represent the x-, y-
               and z-components of the target's position.

               `ptarg' points from the observer's location at `et' to
               the aberration-corrected location of the target.
               Note that the sense of this position vector is
               independent of the direction of radiation travel
               implied by the aberration correction.

               Units are always km.

               Non-inertial frames are treated as follows: letting
               `ltcent' be the one-way light time between the observer
               and the central body associated with the frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at et-ltcent,
               et+ltcent, or `et' depending on whether the requested
               aberration correction is, respectively, for received
               radiation, transmitted radiation, or is omitted.
               `ltcent' is computed using the method indicated by
               `abcorr'.

      lt       the one-way light time(s) between the observer and target in
               seconds.

               [1,n] = size(lt); double = class(lt)

               If the target position is corrected for aberrations, then
               `lt' is the one-way light time between the observer and the
               light time corrected target location.

               `ptarg' and `lt' return with the same vectorization
               measure, N, as `et'.

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Load a planetary SPK, and look up the position of Mars
      as seen from the Earth in the J2000 frame with aberration
      corrections 'LT+S' (ligth time plus stellar aberration) at
      different epochs.

</pre><h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4><pre>

   A sister version of this routine exists named <a href="mice_spkpos.html">mice_spkpos</a> that returns
   the output arguments as fields in a single structure.

   This routine is part of the user interface to the SPICE ephemeris
   system. It allows you to retrieve position information for any
   ephemeris object relative to any other in a reference frame that
   is convenient for further computations.

   Please refer to the Aberration Corrections Required Reading
   abcorr.req for detailed information describing the nature and
   calculation of the applied corrections.

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  If name of target or observer cannot be translated to its NAIF
       ID code, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  If the reference frame `ref' is not a recognized reference
       frame, the error SPICE(UNKNOWNFRAME) is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   3)  If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute the
       requested position vector, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
       the error  is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   5)  If any of the input arguments, `targ', `et', `ref', `abcorr'
       or `obs', is undefined, an error is signaled by the Matlab
       error handling system.

   6)  If any of the input arguments, `targ', `et', `ref', `abcorr'
       or `obs', is not of the expected type, or it does not have the
       expected dimensions and size, an error is signaled by the Mice
       interface.

</pre><h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4><pre>

   This routine computes positions using SPK files that have been loaded
   into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading interface routine
   <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>. See the routine <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> and the SPK and KERNEL
   Required Reading for further information on loading (and unloading)
   kernels.

   If the output position `ptarg' is to be expressed relative to a
   non-inertial frame, or if any of the ephemeris data used to
   compute `ptarg' are expressed relative to a non-inertial frame in
   the SPK files providing those data, additional kernels may be
   needed to enable the reference frame transformations required to
   compute the position. These additional kernels may be C-kernels,
   PCK files or frame kernels. Any such kernels must already be
   loaded at the time this routine is called.

   -Mice Version 1.1.0, 02-NOV-2021 (EDW) (JDR)

       Changed output argument name &quot;pos&quot; to &quot;ptarg&quot;.

       Edited the header to comply with NAIF standard. Added
       example's problem statement and meta-kernel.

       Extended -I/O section.

       Added -Parameters, -Exceptions, -Files, -Restrictions,
       -Literature_References and -Author_and_Institution sections.

       Eliminated use of &quot;lasterror&quot; in rethrow.

       Removed reference to the function's corresponding CSPICE header from
       -Required_Reading section.

       Updated -Particulars to refer to Aberration Corrections
       Required Reading document, which was added to
       -Required_Reading list.

   -Mice Version 1.0.4, 03-DEC-2014 (EDW)

       Corrections made to -Version section numbering. 07-NOV-2013
       notation now numbered as 1.0.2, and Version 1.0.3, 03-JUL-2014.

       Corrections made to author identifiers for Version 1.0.3,
       03-JUL-2014, and Version 1.0.2, 07-NOV-2013 to indicate institution.

   -Mice Version 1.0.3, 03-JUL-2014 (NJB) (BVS) (EDW)

       Discussion of light time corrections was updated. Assertions
       that converged light time corrections are unlikely to be
       useful were removed.

   -Mice Version 1.0.2, 07-NOV-2013 (EDW)

       Added aberration algorithm explanation to -Particulars section.

   -Mice Version 1.0.1, 22-DEC-2008 (EDW)
