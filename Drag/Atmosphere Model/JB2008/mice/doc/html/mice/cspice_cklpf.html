   CSPICE_CKLPF loads a CK pointing file for use by the CK readers.
   This routine returns that file's handle, to be used by other CK
   routines to refer to the file.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      fname    the name of a C-kernel file to be loaded.

               [1,c1] = size(fname); char = class(fname)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(fname); cell = class(fname)

   the call:

      [handle] = <b>cspice_cklpf</b>( fname )

   returns:

      handle   an integer handle assigned to the file upon loading.

               [1,1] = size(handle); int32 = class(handle)

               Almost every other CK routine will subsequently use this
               number to refer to the file.

</pre><h4><a name="Parameters">Parameters</a></h4><pre>

   FTSIZE      is the maximum number of CK files that may
               be loaded simultaneously under any circumstances.
               FTSIZE is currently set to match the maximum number
               of DAF files that may be loaded simultaneously.

</pre><h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4><pre>

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) The following example will extract the entire comment area of a
      CK, displaying the comments on the terminal screen.


      Example code begins here.


      function cklpf_ex1()

         LINLEN =   1001;
         BUFFSZ =   25;

         done   = false;

         ckname = input( 'Enter name of CK &gt; ', 's' );

         %
         % Open the CK for read access. This operation could have
         % been done with <a href="cspice_dafopr.html">cspice_dafopr</a>.
         %
         [handle] = <b>cspice_cklpf</b>( ckname );

         while  ~ done
            [buffer, done] = <a href="cspice_dafec.html">cspice_dafec</a>( handle, BUFFSZ, LINLEN );
            lines = cellstr( buffer );

            for i=1:length(lines)

               fprintf( '%s\n', char(lines(i)) )

            end
         end


      When this program was executed on a Mac/Intel/Octave6.x/64-bit
      platform, using the Cassini CK file named 04161_04164ra.bc as
      input CK file, the output was:

      Cassini Spacecraft Orientation Reconstructed CK File
      =====================================================================***

           Comments added by Lee Elson, NAIF/JPL, Wed Jun 29 15:05:33 PDT 2005


      Orientation Data in the File
      --------------------------------------------------------

           This file contains reconstructed orientation and angular velocity
           data for the Cassini Orbiter spacecraft frame, 'CASSINI_SC_COORD',
           relative to the 'J2000' inertial frame. The NAIF ID code for the
           'CASSINI_SC_COORD' frame is -82000.


      Status
      --------------------------------------------------------

           The data in this file were created by the Cassini Project for
           archiving with the Planetary Data System (PDS).


      Pedigree
      --------------------------------------------------------

           Reconstructed CK files were delivered to the Cassini Project by the
           Attitude and Articulation Subsystem (AACS). These reconstructed
           files contain spacecraft orientation and angular rates returned
           in Cassini spacecraft telemetry.  The data were packaged by AACS
           using the SPICE utility MSOPCK provided by NAIF.  Later files
           were created by accessing the MSOPCK software through the AACS
           C-Kernel Generation Tool (ACKT) user interface.

           Files generated prior to January 2004 have been merged to remove
           redundant data and in some cases provide longer interpolation
           intervals since the spacecraft was primarily earth pointed during
           that time.

      Approximate Time Coverage
      --------------------------------------------------------

           This file covers the following interval of the mission:

                Coverage Begin UTC       Coverage End UTC
                ------------------------ ------------------------
                2004-JUN-09 12:00:03.631 2004-JUN-12 11:58:57.943

           This file is a type 3 CK file which allows linear interpolation
           between orientation data points extracted from telemetry. Such
           interpolation is not applicable to the whole file but only inside
           intervals where enough orientation telemetry data are available
           and orientation data points were close enough to each other in time
           for such interpolation to make sense.

           The nominal quaternion time spacing in the telemetry stream is
           4 seconds but a spacing as large as 16 seconds may exist between
           adjacent data points.

           A table containing the complete list of valid interpolation inte***
           in the file is provided in Appendix 2.

      Related Information
      --------------------------------------------------------

           AACS has carried out comparisons between some predicted CK
           files and the corresponding reconstructed CK files. Numerical

   Before a file can be read by the C-kernel readers, it must be
   loaded by <b>cspice_cklpf</b>, which among other things load the file into
   the DAF subsystem.

   Up to FTSIZE files may be loaded for use simultaneously, and a
   file only has to be loaded once to become a potential search
   target for any number of subsequent reads.

   Once a C-kernel has been loaded, it is assigned a file
   handle, which is used to keep track of the file internally, and
   which is used by the calling program to refer to the file in all
   subsequent calls to CK routines.

   If there is room for a new file, <b>cspice_cklpf</b> opens the file for
   reading. This routine must be called prior to a call to <a href="cspice_ckgp.html">cspice_ckgp</a> or
   <a href="cspice_ckgpav.html">cspice_ckgpav</a>.

   CK readers search files loaded with <b>cspice_cklpf</b> in the reverse order
   in which they were loaded. That is, last-loaded files are
   searched first.

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  If an attempt is made to load more DAF files than is
       specified by the parameter FTSIZE in DAF system, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  If an attempt is made to load more files than is specified by
       the parameter FTSIZE in the CK subsystem, and if the DAF
       system has room to load another file, the error
       SPICE(CKTOOMANYFILES) is signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine. The current setting of FTSIZE does not
       allow this situation to arise: the DAF system will trap the
       error before this routine has the chance.

   3)  If the file specified by `fname' can not be opened, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If the file specified by `fname' has already been loaded,
       it will become the &quot;last-loaded&quot; file. The readers
       search the last-loaded file first.

   5)  If the input argument `fname' is undefined, an error is
       signaled by the Matlab error handling system.

   6)  If the input argument `fname' is not of the expected type, or
       it does not have the expected dimensions and size, an error is
       signaled by the Mice interface.

</pre><h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4><pre>

   The C-kernel file specified by `fname' is loaded. The file is
   assigned an integer handle by <b>cspice_cklpf</b>. Other CK routines will refer
   to this file by its handle.
