   CSPICE_FOVTRG determines if a specified ephemeris object is within
   the field-of-view (FOV) of a specified instrument at a given time.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      inst     indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
               spacecraft-mounted framing camera.

               [1,c1] = size(inst); char = class(inst)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(inst); cell = class(inst)

               The field of view (FOV) of the instrument will be used to
               determine if the target is visible with respect to the
               instrument.

               The position of the instrument `inst' is considered to
               coincide with that of the ephemeris object `obsrvr' (see
               description below).

               The size of the instrument's FOV is constrained by the
               following: There must be a vector A such that all of
               the instrument's FOV boundary vectors have an angular
               separation from A of less than (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians
               (see description below). For FOVs that are circular or
               elliptical, the vector A is the boresight. For FOVs
               that are rectangular or polygonal, the vector A is
               calculated.

               See the header of the Mice routine <a href="cspice_getfov.html">cspice_getfov</a> for a
               description of the required parameters associated with
               an instrument.

               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
               example, both 'CASSINI_ISS_NAC' and '-82360' are
               accepted. Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string.

      target   the name of the target body.

               [1,c2] = size(target); char = class(target)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

               This routine determines if the target body appears in the
               instrument's field of view.

               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
               example, both 'Moon' and '301' are accepted. Case and
               leading or trailing blanks are not significant in the
               string.

      tshape   a string indicating the geometric model used to
               represent the shape of the target body.

               [1,c3] = size(tshape); char = class(tshape)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(tshape); cell = class(tshape)

               The supported options are:

                  'ELLIPSOID'     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model,
                                  with radius values provided via the
                                  kernel pool. A kernel variable
                                  having a name of the form

                                     'BODYnnn_RADII'

                                  where nnn represents the NAIF
                                  integer code associated with the
                                  body, must be present in the kernel
                                  pool. This variable must be
                                  associated with three numeric
                                  values giving the lengths of the
                                  ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.

                  'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string.

      tframe   the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
               frame associated with the target body.

               [1,c4] = size(tframe); char = class(tframe)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(tframe); cell = class(tframe)

               Examples of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and
               'ITRF93' (for Earth).

               If the target body is modeled as a point, `tframe'
               is ignored and should be left blank. (Ex: ' ').

               Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
               non-blank frame name are not significant in the string.

      abcorr   indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
               when computing the target's position and orientation.

               [1,c5] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
               position and orientation of the target seen by the
               observer are desired, normally either of the
               corrections:

                  'LT+S'
                  'CN+S'

               should be used. These and the other supported options
               are described below.

               Supported aberration correction options for
               observation (the case where radiation is received by
               observer at `et') are:

                  'NONE'         No correction.
                  'LT'           Light time only
                  'LT+S'         Light time and stellar aberration.
                  'CN'           Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                  'CN+S'         CN light time and stellar aberration.

               Supported aberration correction options for
               transmission (the case where radiation is emitted from
               observer at `et') are:

                  'XLT'          Light time only.
                  'XLT+S'        Light time and stellar aberration.
                  'XCN'          Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                  'XCN+S'        CN light time and stellar aberration.

               Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
               in the string.

      obsrvr   the name of the body from which the target is
               observed.

               [1,c6] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

               The instrument `inst' is treated as if it were co-located
               with the observer.

               Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
               example, both 'CASSINI' and '-82' are accepted. Case and
               leading or trailing blanks are not significant in the
               string.

      et       the observation time(s) in seconds past the J2000
               epoch.

               [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)

   the call:

      [visibl] = <b>cspice_fovtrg</b>( inst,   target, tshape, ...
                                tframe, abcorr, obsrvr, et )

   returns:

      visibl   true if `target' is fully or partially in the
               field-of-view of `inst' at the time `et'.

               [1,n] = size(visibl); logical = class(visibl)

               Otherwise, `visibl' is false.

               `visibl' returns with the same vectorization measure, N,
               as `et'.

   SPICE_GF_MAXVRT

               is the maximum number of vertices that may be used
               to define the boundary of the specified instrument's
               field of view.

   SPICE_GF_MARGIN

               is a small positive number used to constrain the
               orientation of the boundary vectors of polygonal
               FOVs. Such FOVs must satisfy the following constraints:

                  1)  The boundary vectors must be contained
                      within a right circular cone of angular radius
                      less than than (pi/2) - SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians;
                      in other words, there must be a vector A such
                      that all boundary vectors have angular
                      separation from A of less than
                      (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians.

                  2)  There must be a pair of boundary vectors U,
                      V such that all other boundary vectors lie in
                      the same half space bounded by the plane
                      containing U and V. Furthermore, all other
                      boundary vectors must have orthogonal
                      projections onto a specific plane normal to this
                      plane (the normal plane contains the angle
                      bisector defined by U and V) such that the
                      projections have angular separation of at least
                      2*SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians from the plane spanned
                      by U and V.

               SPICE_GF_MARGIN is currently set to 1.e-12.

   See Mice header file MiceGF.m for declarations and descriptions of
   parameters used throughout the GF system.

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) A spectacular picture was taken by Cassini's
      narrow-angle camera on Oct. 6, 2010 that shows
      six of Saturn's moons. Let's verify that the moons
      in the picture are Epimetheus, Atlas, Daphnis, Pan,
      Janus, and Enceladus.

      To see this picture, visit:

      When this program was executed on a Mac/Intel/Octave5.x/64-bit
      platform, the output was:


      At time 2010-OCT-06 17:09:45.346 (TDB) the following were
      in the field of view of CASSINI_ISS_NAC
        ENCELADUS
        JANUS
        EPIMETHEUS
        ATLAS
        PAN
        DAPHNIS
        ANTHE


      Note: there were actually 7 of Saturn's satellites in the
      field-of-view of Cassini's narrow-angle camera. However, Anthe
      is very small and was probably obscured by other objects or
      shadow.

   To treat the target as a ray rather than as an ephemeris object,
   use the higher-level Mice routine <a href="cspice_fovray.html">cspice_fovray</a>. <a href="cspice_fovray.html">cspice_fovray</a> may be used
   to determine if distant target objects such as stars are visible
   in an instrument's FOV at a given time, as long as the direction
   from the observer to the target can be modeled as a ray.

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  If the name of either the target or observer cannot be
       translated to a NAIF ID code, an error is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  If the specified aberration correction is an unrecognized
       value, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   3)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot
       be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel
       variable having a name of the form

          'BODYnnn_RADII'

       where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with
       the body, an error is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   4)  If the target and observer bodies are the same, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   5)  If the body model specifier `tshape' is invalid, an error is
       signaled by either this routine or a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   6)  If a target body-fixed reference frame associated with a
       non-point target is not recognized, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If a target body-fixed reference frame is not centered at the
       corresponding target body, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   8)  If the instrument name `inst' does not have a corresponding NAIF
       ID code, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of
       this routine.

   9)  If the FOV parameters of the instrument are not present in
       the kernel pool, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   10) If the FOV boundary has more than SPICE_GF_MAXVRT vertices, an error
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   11) If the instrument FOV shape is a polygon or rectangle, and
       this routine cannot find a ray R emanating from the FOV vertex
       such that maximum angular separation of R and any FOV boundary
       vector is within the limit (pi/2)-SPICE_GF_MARGIN radians, an
       error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.
       If the FOV is any other shape, the same error check will be
       applied with the instrument boresight vector serving the role
       of R.

   12) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute a
       requested state vector, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   13) If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
       the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   14) If any of the input arguments, `inst', `target', `tshape',
       `tframe', `abcorr', `obsrvr' or `et', is undefined, an error
       is signaled by the Matlab error handling system.

   15) If any of the input arguments, `inst', `target', `tshape',
       `tframe', `abcorr', `obsrvr' or `et', is not of the expected
       type, or it does not have the expected dimensions and size, an
       error is signaled by the Mice interface.

   Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
   before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for target and observer that
      describe the ephemerides of these objects at the time `et'.
      If aberration corrections are used, the states of
      target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
      must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
      the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
      the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
      pool. Typically the definitions of frames not already
      built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading a frame kernel.

   -  Data defining the reference frame in which the instrument's
      FOV is defined must be available in the kernel pool.
      Additionally the name `inst' must be associated with an ID
      code.

   -  IK data: the kernel pool must contain data such that
      the Mice routine <a href="cspice_getfov.html">cspice_getfov</a> may be called to obtain
      parameters for `inst'.

   The following data may be required:

   -  PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
      orientation data provided by variables in the kernel pool.

      Bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have radii
      lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.

   -  CK data: if the frame in which the instrument's FOV is
      defined is fixed to a spacecraft, at least one CK file will
      be needed to permit transformation of vectors between that
      frame and both J2000 and the target body-fixed frame.

   -  SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
      kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
      (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
      (TDB).

   Kernel data are normally loaded via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> once per program run,
   NOT every time this routine is called.

</pre><h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  The reference frame associated with `inst' must be centered at
       the observer or must be inertial. No check is done to ensure
       this.
