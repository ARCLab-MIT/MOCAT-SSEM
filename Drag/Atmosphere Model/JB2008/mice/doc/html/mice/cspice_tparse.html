   CSPICE_TPARSE parses a time string and returns seconds past the J2000
   epoch on a formal calendar.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      string   an input time string, containing a Calendar or Julian Date.

               [1,c1] = size(string); char = class(string)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(string); cell = class(string)

               It may be in several different formats and can make use of
               abbreviations. Several example strings and the times that
               they translate to are listed below in the -Examples section.

   the call:

      [sp2000, errmsg] = <b>cspice_tparse</b>( string )

   returns:

      sp2000   the equivalent of UTC, expressed in UTC seconds past J2000.

               [1,1] = size(sp2000); double = class(sp2000)

               If an error occurs, or if the input time string is
               ambiguous, `sp2000' is not changed.

      errmsg   a descriptive error message, which is blank when no error
               occurs.

               [1,c2] = size(errmsg); char = class(errmsg)

</pre><h4><a name="Parameters">Parameters</a></h4><pre>

   None.

</pre><h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4><pre>

   Any numerical results shown for these examples may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Parse a series of time strings representing calendar dates and
      output number of seconds past J2000 epoch that corresponds to
      each of them. Some of the input strings have an invalid format
      which is reflected in their output.


      Example code begins here.


      function tparse_ex1()

         %
         % Assign an array of calendar dates. Not all of them are
         % valid.
         %
         date = { '1986-01-18T12:19:52.18',  '17JUN1982 18:28:28',         ...
                  '182-''92/ 12:28:29.182',  '''67-271/ 12:28:30.291',     ...
                  '-467-14-25 26:00:75',     '1993 FEB 35',                ...
                  '1993 MAR 7' };

         %
         % Loop over the `date' array, call <b>cspice_tparse</b> for each element.
         %
         fprintf( '    Input string        UTC sec past J2000\n' )
         fprintf( '----------------------  ------------------\n' )

         for i=1:7

            [sp2000, errmsg] = <b>cspice_tparse</b>( date(i) );

            if ( strcmp( errmsg, '' ) )

               fprintf( '%-22s   %17.6f\n', char(date(i)), sp2000 )

            else

               fprintf( '%-22s  %s\n', char(date(i)), errmsg )

            end

         end


      When this program was executed on a PC/Linux/Matlab9.x/32-bit
      platform, the output was:


          Input string        UTC sec past J2000

      margin of the header and has been truncated. This line is
      marked by &quot;***&quot; at the end of the line.


      Note that the &quot;1993 FEB 35&quot; string in converted to UTC seconds
      past J2000, interpreted as &quot;1993 MAR 7&quot;.


   2) Below is a sampling of some of the time formats that are
      acceptable as inputs to <b>cspice_tparse</b>. A complete discussion of
      permissible formats is given in the reference document

      *  The default interpretation of a year that has been
         abbreviated to two digits with or without a leading quote
         as in 'xy or xy (such as '92 or 92) is to treat the year as
         19xy if xy &gt; 68 and to treat it as 20xy otherwise. Thus '70
         is interpreted as 1970 and '67 is treated as 2067. However,
         you may change the &quot;split point&quot; and centuries through use
         of the Mice routine <a href="cspice_tsetyr.html">cspice_tsetyr</a>. See that routine for a
         discussion of how you may reset the split point.

      ** All epochs are regarded as belonging to the Gregorian
         calendar. We formally extend the Gregorian calendar backward
         and forward in time for all epochs. If you have epochs
         belonging to the Julian Calendar, consult the SPICELIB
         routines TPARTV and JUL2GR for a discussion concerning
         conversions to the Gregorian calendar and ET. The routines
         cspice_timdef and <a href="cspice_str2et.html">cspice_str2et</a>, used together, also support
         conversions from Julian Calendar epochs to ET.

      +  When a day of year format or calendar format string is
         input and neither of the integer components of the date is
         greater than 1000, the first integer is regarded as being
         the year.

      Any integer greater than 1000 is regarded as a year
      specification. Thus 1001-1821//12:28:28 is interpreted as
      specifying two years and will be rejected as ambiguous.

</pre><h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4><pre>

   The input string is examined and the various components of a date
   are identified: julian date, year, month, day of year, day of
   month, hour, minutes, seconds. These items are assumed to be
   components on a calendar that contains no leapseconds (i.e. every
   day is assumed to have exactly 86400 seconds).

   <b>cspice_tparse</b> recognizes a wide range of standard time formats. The
   -Examples section contains a list of several common strings that
   are recognized and their interpretation. <b>cspice_tparse</b> relies on the
   lower level SPICELIB routine TPARTV to interpret the input string.

   Here is a brief summary of some of the basic rules used in the
   interpretation of strings.

   1)  Unless the substring 'JD' or 'jd' is present, the string is
       assumed to be a calendar format (day-month-year or year and
       day of year). If the substring JD or jd is present, the
       string is assumed to represent a Julian date.

   2)  If the Julian date specifier is not present, any integer
       greater than 999 is regarded as being a year specification.

   3)  A dash '-' can represent a minus sign only if it precedes
       the first digit in the string and the string contains
       the Julian date specifier (JD). (No negative years,
       months, days, etc. are allowed).

   4)  Numeric components of a time string must be separated
       by a character that is not a digit or decimal point.
       Only one decimal component is allowed. For example
       1994219.12819 is sometimes interpreted as the
       219th day of 1994 + 0.12819 days. <b>cspice_tparse</b> does not
       support such strings.

   5)  No exponential components are allowed. For example you
       can't specify the Julian date of J2000 as 2.451545E6.
       You also can't input 1993 Jun 23 23:00:01.202E-4 and have
       to explicitly list all zeros that follow the decimal
       point: i.e. 1993 Jun 23 23:00:00.0001202.

   6)  The single colon (:) when used to separate numeric
       components of a string is interpreted as separating
       Hours, Minutes, and Seconds of time.

   7)  If a double slash (//) or double colon (::) follows
       a pair of integers, those integers are assumed  to
       represent the year and day of year.

   8)  A quote followed by an integer less than 100 is regarded
       as an abbreviated year. For example: '93 would be regarded
       as the 93rd year of the reference century. See the SPICELIB
       routine TEXPYR for further discussion of abbreviated years.

   9)  An integer followed by 'B.C.' or 'A.D.' is regarded as
       a year in the era associated with that abbreviation.

   10) All dates are regarded as belonging to the extended
       Gregorian Calendar (the Gregorian calendar is the calendar
       currently used by western society). See the SPICELIB routine
       JUL2GR for converting from Julian Calendar to the Gregorian
       Calendar.

   11) If the ISO date-time separator (T) is present in the string
       ISO allowed token patterns are examined for a match
       with the current token list. If no match is found the
       search is abandoned and appropriate diagnostic messages
       are generated. Historically the interpretation of ISO 
       formatted time strings deviates from the ISO standard in 
       allowing two digit years and expanding years in the 0 to 99 
       range the same way as is done for non ISO formatted strings. 
       Due to this interpretation it is impossible to specify 
       times in years in the 0 A.D. to 99 A.D. range using ISO 
       formatted strings on the input.

   12) If two delimiters are found in succession in the time
       string, the time string is diagnosed as an erroneous string.
       (Delimiters are comma, white space, dash, slash, period, or
       day of year mark. The day of year mark is a pair of forward
       slashes or a pair of colons.)

       Note the delimiters do not have to be the same. The pair
       of characters ',-' counts as two successive delimiters.

   13) White space and commas serve only to delimit tokens in the
       input string. They do not affect the meaning of any
       of the tokens.

   14) If an integer is greater than 1000 (and the 'JD' label
       is not present, the integer is regarded as a year.

   15) When the size of the integer components does not clearly
       specify a year the following patterns are assumed

       Calendar Format

          Year Month Day
          Month Day Year
          Year Day Month

          where Month is the name of a month, not its numeric
          value.

          When integer components are separated by slashes (/)
          as in 3/4/5. Month, Day, Year is assumed (2005 March 4)

       Day of Year Format.

          If a day of year marker is present (// or ::) the
          pattern

            I-I// or I-I:: (where I stands for an integer)

          is interpreted as Year Day-of-Year. However, I-I/ is
          regarded as ambiguous.

   To understand the complete list of strings that can be understood
   by <b>cspice_tparse</b> you need to examine the SPICELIB routine TPARTV and read
   the appendix to the TIME required reading entitled &quot;Parsing Time
   Strings.&quot;

   <b>cspice_tparse</b> does not support the specification of time system
   such as TDT or TDB; AM/PM specifications of time; or time
   zones (such as PDT, UTC+7:20, etc.).

   If some part of the time string is not recognized or if
   the meaning of the components are not clear, an error string
   is constructed that explains the problem with the string.

   Since the routine works by breaking the input string into
   a sequence of tokens whose meanings are determined by position
   and magnitude, you can supply strings such as 1993 FEB 35 and
   have this correctly interpreted as March 7, 1993. However,
   this default action can be modified so that only &quot;proper&quot;
   calendar dates and times are recognized. To do this call
   the routine <a href="cspice_tparch.html">cspice_tparch</a> as shown below:

      <a href="cspice_tparch.html">cspice_tparch</a>( 'YES' );

   This will cause the routine to treat dates and times with
   components outside the normal range as errors.

   To return to the default behavior

      <a href="cspice_tparch.html">cspice_tparch</a>( 'NO' );

   This routine returns information about parse errors in the output
   string `errmsg'.

   1)  If the input argument `string' is undefined, an error is
       signaled by the Matlab error handling system.

   2)  If the input argument `string' is not of the expected type, or
       it does not have the expected dimensions and size, an error is
       signaled by the Mice interface.
