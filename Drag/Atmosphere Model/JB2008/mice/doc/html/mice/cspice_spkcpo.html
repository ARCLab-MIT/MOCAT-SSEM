   CSPICE_SPKCPO returns the state of a specified target relative to
   an &quot;observer,&quot; where the observer has constant position in a
   specified reference frame. The observer's position is provided
   by the calling program rather than by loaded SPK files.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      target   name of a target body. Optionally, you may supply
               the ID code of the object as an integer string. For
               example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate strings
               to supply to indicate the target is earth.

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not significant
               in the string `target'.

               [1,c1] = size(target), char = class(target)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

      et       ephemeris time at which the state of the target relative to
               the observer is to be computed. `et' is expressed as seconds
               past J2000 TDB. `et' refers to time at the observer's
               location.

               [1,1] = size(et), double = class(et)

      outref   name of the reference frame with respect to which
               the output state is expressed.

               When `outref' is time-dependent (non-inertial), its
               orientation relative to the J2000 frame is evaluated in
               the manner commanded by the input argument `refloc' (see
               description below).

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not significant
               in the string `outref'.

               [1,c2] = size(outref), char = class(outref)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(outref); cell = class(outref)

      refloc   name indicating the output reference frame
               evaluation locus: this is the location associated
               with the epoch at which this routine is to evaluate
               the orientation, relative to the J2000 frame, of the
               output frame `outref'. The values and meanings of
               `refloc' are:

                  'OBSERVER'  Evaluate `outref' at the observer's
                              epoch `et'.

                              Normally the locus 'OBSERVER' should
                              be selected when `outref' is centered
                              at the observer.

                  'TARGET'    Evaluate `outref' at the target epoch;
                              letting `lt' be the one-way light time
                              between the target and observer, the
                              target epoch is

                                 et-lt  if reception aberration
                                        corrections are used

                                 et+lt  if transmission aberration
                                        corrections are used

                                 et     if no aberration corrections
                                        are used

                              Normally the locus 'TARGET' should
                              be selected when `outref' is centered
                              at the target object.

                  'CENTER'    Evaluate the frame `outref' at the epoch
                              associated its center. This epoch,
                              which we'll call `etctr', is determined
                              as follows:

                                 Let `ltctr' be the one-way light time
                                 between the observer and the center
                                 of `outref'. Then `etctr' is

                                    et-ltctr  if reception
                                              aberration corrections
                                              are used

                                    et+ltctr  if transmission
                                              aberration corrections
                                              are used

                                    et        if no aberration
                                              corrections are used


                              The locus 'CENTER' should be selected
                              when the user intends to obtain
                              results compatible with those produced
                              by <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a>.

               When `outref' is inertial, all choices of `refloc'
               yield the same results.

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `refloc'.

               [1,c3] = size(refloc), char = class(refloc)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(refloc); cell = class(refloc)

      abcorr   scalar string name indicating the aberration corrections to be
               applied to the observer-target state to account for one-way
               light time and stellar aberration.

               `abcorr' may be any of the following:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric state of the target
                             relative to the observer.

               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at `et':

                  'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the state of the target at the
                             moment it emitted photons arriving at
                             the observer at `et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             'LT' option uses one iteration.

                  'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent
                             state of the target---the position and
                             velocity of the target as seen by the
                             observer.

                  'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                             until the solution converges.

                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                             and stellar aberration corrections.


               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             state of the target at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at `et'.

                  'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation  This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the 'XLT' option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The position component of
                             the computed target state indicates the
                             direction that photons emitted from the
                             observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                             hit the target.

                  'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.


               Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
               accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
               by this routine.

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `abcorr'.

               [1,c4] = size(abcorr), char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

      obspos   fixed (constant) geometric position of an observer
               relative to its center of motion `obsctr', expressed in
               the reference frame `obsref'.

               Units are always km.

               [3,1] = size(obspos), double = class(obspos)

      obsctr   name of the center of motion of `obspos'. The
               ephemeris of `obsctr' is provided by loaded SPK files.

               Optionally, you may supply the integer ID code for
               the object as an integer string. For example both
               'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate
               the moon is the center of motion.

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `obsctr'.

               [1,c5] = size(obsctr), char = class(obsctr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsctr); cell = class(obsctr)

      obsref   name of the reference frame relative to which the
               input position `obspos' is expressed. The observer has
               constant position relative to its center of motion in
               this reference frame.

               Case and leading and trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `obsref'.

               [1,c6] = size(obsref), char = class(obsref)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsref); cell = class(obsref)

   the call:

      [state, lt] = <b>cspice_spkcpo</b>(target, et,     outref, ...
                                  refloc, abcorr, obspos, ...
                                  obsctr, obsref)

   returns:

      state    state of the target relative to the specified
               observer. `state' is corrected for the specified
               aberrations and is expressed with respect to the
               reference frame specified by `outref'. The first three
               components of `state' represent the x-, y- and
               z-components of the target's position; the last three
               components form the corresponding velocity vector.

               The position component of `state' points from the
               observer's location at `et' to the aberration-corrected
               location of the target. Note that the sense of the
               position vector is independent of the direction of
               radiation travel implied by the aberration
               correction.

               The velocity component of `state' is the derivative
               with respect to time of the position component of
               `state'.

               Units are always km and km/sec.

               When `state' is expressed in a time-dependent
               (non-inertial) output frame, the orientation of that
               frame relative to the J2000 frame is evaluated in the
               manner indicated by the input argument `refloc' (see
               description above).

               [6,1] = size(state), double = class(state)

      lt       one-way light time between the observer
               and target in seconds. If the target state is corrected
               for aberrations, then `lt' is the one-way light time
               between the observer and the light time corrected
               target location.

               [1,1] = size(lt), double = class(lt)

   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Compute apparent solar azimuth and elevation as seen from a
      specified surface point on the earth.

      Task Description
      ================

      In this example we'll use the location of the DSN station
      DSS-14 as our surface point.

      We'll perform the solar azimuth and elevation computation two
      ways:

         - Using a station frame kernel to provide the
           specification of a topocentric reference frame
           centered at DSS-14.

         - Computing inline the transformation from the earth-fixed,
           earth-centered frame ITRF93 to a topocentric frame
           centered at DSS-14.


      Note that results of the two computations will differ
      slightly. There are three sources of the differences:

         1) The station position is time-dependent due to tectonic
            plate motion, and epochs of the station positions used
            to specify the axes of the topocentric frame are
            different in the two cases. This gives rise to different
            orientations of the frame's axes relative to the frame
            ITRF93.

         2) The two computations use different earth radii; this
            results in computation of different geodetic latitudes
            of the station. This difference also affects the
            topocentric frame orientation relative to ITRF93.

         3) The station movement between ET and the epoch at which
            the DSS-14_TOPO frame is specified contributes a very
            small offset---on the order of 10 cm---to the station-sun
            position vector, expressed in the ITRF93 frame.

   This routine computes observer-target states for observers whose
   trajectories are not provided by SPK files.

   Observers supported by this routine must have constant position
   with respect to a specified center of motion, expressed in a
   caller-specified reference frame. The state of the center of
   motion relative to the target must be computable using
   loaded SPK data.

   For applications in which the observer has constant, non-zero velocity
   relative to its center of motion, the Mice routine

      <a href="cspice_spkcvo.html">cspice_spkcvo</a>     { SPK, constant velocity observer state }

   can be used.

   This routine is suitable for computing states of target ephemeris
   objects, as seen from landmarks on the surface of an extended
   object, in cases where no SPK data are available for those
   landmarks.

   This routine's treatment of the output reference frame differs
   from that of the principal SPK API routines

      <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a>
      <a href="cspice_spkpos.html">cspice_spkpos</a>

   which require both observer and target ephemerides to be provided
   by loaded SPK files:

      The SPK API routines listed above evaluate the orientation of the
      output reference frame (with respect to the J2000 frame) at an
      epoch corrected for one-way light time between the observer and
      the center of the output frame. When the center of the output
      frame is not the target (for example, when the target is on the
      surface of Mars and the output frame is centered at Mars'
      center), the epoch of evaluation may not closely match the
      light-time corrected epoch associated with the target itself. A
      similar problem may occur when the observer is a surface point on
      an extended body and the output frame is centered at the body
      center: the listed routines will correct the orientation of the
      output frame for one-way light time between the frame center and
      the observer.

      This routine allows the caller to dictate how the orientation
      of the output reference frame is to be evaluated. The caller
      passes to this routine an input string called the output
      frame's evaluation &quot;locus.&quot; This string specifies the location
      associated with the output frame's evaluation epoch. The three
      possible values of the locus are

         'TARGET'
         'OBSERVER'
         'CENTER'

      The choice of locus has an effect when aberration corrections
      are used and the output frame is non-inertial.

      When the locus is 'TARGET' and light time corrections are
      used, the orientation of the output frame is evaluated at the
      epoch obtained by correcting the observation epoch `et' for
      one-way light time `lt'. The evaluation epoch will be either
      et-lt or et+lt for reception or transmission corrections
      respectively.

      For remote sensing applications where the target is a surface
      point on an extended object, and the orientation of that
      object should be evaluated at the emission time, the locus
      'TARGET' should be used.

      When the output frame's orientation should be evaluated at
      the observation epoch `et', which is the case when the
      output frame is centered at the observer, the locus
      'OBSERVER' should be used.

      The locus option 'CENTER' is provided for compatibility
      with existing SPK state computation APIs such as <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a>.

      Note that the output frame evaluation locus does not affect
      the computation of light time between the target and
      observer.

   combinations of objects having ephemerides provided by the SPK
   system and objects having constant position or constant velocity

       the expected type, or it does not have the expected dimensions
       and size, an error is signaled by the Mice interface.

   Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
   this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for the observer center and target
      must be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the
      states of the observer center and target relative to the
      solar system barycenter must be calculable from the
      available ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data are made
      available by loading one or more SPK files using <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   The following data may be required:

   -  PCK data: if the target frame is a PCK frame, rotation data
      for the target frame must be loaded. These may be provided
      in a text or binary PCK file.

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition not built into SPICE is
      required, for example to convert the observer-target state
      to the output frame, that definition must be available in
      the kernel pool. Typically frame definitions are supplied
      by loading a frame kernel using <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  Additional kernels: if any frame used in this routine's
      state computation is a CK frame, then at least one CK and
      corresponding SCLK kernel is required. If dynamic frames
      are used, additional SPK, PCK, CK, or SCLK kernels may be
      required.

   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   1)  This routine may not be suitable for work with stars or other
       objects having large distances from the observer, due to loss
       of precision in position vectors.

   -Mice Version 1.1.0, 10-AUG-2021 (EDW) (JDR)

       Added -Parameters, -Exceptions, -Files, -Restrictions,
       -Literature_References and -Author_and_Institution sections. Fixed
       format in -I/O section. Corrected typos in -Particulars section.

       Edited the header to comply with NAIF standard.
       Added example's task description.

       Eliminated use of &quot;lasterror&quot; in rethrow.

       Removed reference to the function's corresponding CSPICE header from
       -Required_Reading section.
