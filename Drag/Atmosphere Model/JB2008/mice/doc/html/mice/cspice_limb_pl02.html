<PRE>
</pre><h4><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h4><pre>

   Deprecated: This routine has been superseded by the Mice routine
   <a href="cspice_limbpt.html">cspice_limbpt</a>. This routine is supported for purposes of backward
   compatibility only.

   CSPICE_LIMB_PL02 returns a set of points on the limb of a specified
   target body, where the target body's surface is represented by a
   triangular plate model contained in a type 2 DSK segment.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      handle   the DAS file handle of a DSK file open for read
               access.

               [1,1] = size(handle); int32 = class(handle)

               This kernel must contain a type 2 segment that provides a
               plate model representing the entire surface of the target
               body.

      dladsc   the DLA descriptor of a DSK segment representing
               the surface of a target body.

               [SPICE_DLA_DSCSIZ,1] = size(dladsc); int32 = class(dladsc)

      target   the name of the target body.

               [1,c1] = size(target); char = class(target)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

               `target' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks
               in `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may supply
               a string containing the integer ID code for the object.
               For example both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings
               that indicate the moon is the target body.

               This routine assumes that the target body's surface is
               represented using a plate model, and that a DSK file
               containing the plate model has been loaded via <a href="cspice_dasopr.html">cspice_dasopr</a>.

      et       the epoch of participation of the observer,
               expressed as ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: `et' is
               the epoch at which the observer's position is
               computed.

               [1,1] = size(et); double = class(et)

               When aberration corrections are not used, `et' is also
               the epoch at which the position and orientation of the
               target body are computed.

               When aberration corrections are used, `et' is the epoch
               at which the observer's position relative to the solar
               system barycenter is computed; in this case the position
               and orientation of the target body are computed at
               et-lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time between the
               target body's center and the observer. See the
               description of `abcorr' below for details.

      fixfrm   the name of the reference frame relative to which the
               output limb points are expressed.

               [1,c2] = size(fixfrm); char = class(fixfrm)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(fixfrm); cell = class(fixfrm)

               This must a body-centered, body-fixed frame associated with
               the target. The frame's axes must be compatible with the
               triaxial ellipsoidal shape model associated with the
               target body (normally provide via a PCK): this routine
               assumes that the first, second, and third ellipsoid radii
               correspond, respectively, to the x, y, and z-axes of the
               frame designated by `fixfrm'.

               `fixfrm' may refer to a built-in frame (documented in
               the Frames Required Reading) or a frame defined by a
               loaded frame kernel (FK).

               The orientation of the frame designated by `fixfrm' is
               evaluated at epoch of participation of the target
               body. See the descriptions of `et' and `abcorr' for
               details.

      abcorr   indicates the aberration correction to be applied
               when computing the observer-target position, the
               orientation of the target body, and the target-
               source position vector.

               [1,c3] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               `abcorr' may be any of the following.

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction. Compute the limb
                             points using the position of the observer
                             and target, and the orientation of the
                             target, at `et'.

               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the
               observer and the target body's center. The following
               values of `abcorr' apply to the &quot;reception&quot; case in
               which photons depart from the target body's center at
               the light-time corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at
               the observer's location at `et':


                  'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the location of the limb points at
                             the approximate time they emitted photons
                             arriving at the observer at `et' (the
                             difference between light time to the
                             target center and light time to the limb
                             points is ignored).

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             'LT' option uses one iteration.

                             The target position as seen by the
                             observer and the rotation of the target
                             body are corrected for light time.

                  'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian formulation.
                             This option modifies the position obtained
                             with the 'LT' option to account for the
                             observer's velocity relative to the solar
                             system barycenter. The result is the
                             apparent limb as seen by the observer.

                  'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time correction.
                             In solving the light time equation, the
                             'CN' correction iterates until the
                             solution converges. The position and
                             rotation of the target body are corrected
                             for light time.

                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                             and stellar aberration corrections.


      obsrvr   the name of the observing body.

               [1,c4] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

               This is typically a spacecraft, the Earth, or a surface point
               on the Earth. `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and
               trailing blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant.
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
               integer ID code for the object. For example both
               'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate strings that indicate
               the Earth is the observer.

      npts     the number of limb points to compute.

               [1,1] = size(npts); int32 = class(npts)

               For values of `npts' less-than or equal-to zero,
               the output arguments return as zeros and empty arrays.

   the call:

      [trgepc, obspos, lmbpts, pltids] =                                  ...
                                <b>cspice_limb_pl02</b>( handle, dladsc, target, ...
                                                  et,     fixref, abcorr, ...
                                                  obsrvr, npts )

   returns:

      trgepc   the &quot;target epoch.&quot;

               [1,1] = size(trgepc); double = class(trgepc)

               `trgepc' is defined as follows: letting `lt' be the one-way
               light time between the target center and observer, `trgepc' is
               either the epoch et-lt or `et' depending on whether the
               requested aberration correction is, respectively, for received
               radiation or omitted. `lt' is computed using the
               method indicated by `abcorr'.

               `trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

      obspos   the vector from the center of the target body at
               epoch `trgepc' to the observer at epoch `et'.

               [3,1] = size(obspos); double = class(obspos)

               `obspos' is expressed in the target body-fixed reference frame
               `fixfrm', which is evaluated at `trgepc'.

               `obspos' is returned to simplify various related
               computations that would otherwise be cumbersome. For
               example, the vector `xvec' from the observer to the
               Ith limb point can be calculated via the expression

                  xvec = imbpts(:,i) - obspos

               The components of `obspos' are given in units of km.

      lmbpts   an array of points on the limb of the target.

               [3,npts] = size(lmbpts); double = class(lmbpts)

               The ith point is contained in the array elements

                   lmbpts(:,i)

               As described above, each limb point lies on a ray
               emanating from the center of the target and passing
               through a limb point on the target's reference
               ellipsoid. Each limb point *on the reference ellipsoid*
               is the point of tangency of a ray that emanates from the
               observer. Measured in a cylindrical coordinate system
               whose Z-axis is parallel to the observer-target vector,
               the magnitude of the separation in longitude between the
               limb points is

                  2*Pi / npts

               The limb points are expressed in the body-fixed
               reference frame designated by `fixfrm'; the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at `trgepc'.
               Units are km.

      pltids   an array of integer ID codes of the plates on which
               the limb points are located.

               [1,npts] = size(pltids); int32 = class(pltids)

               The ith plate ID corresponds to the ith limb point. These ID
               codes can be use to look up data associated with the plates,
               such as the plates' vertices or outward normal vectors.

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Compute a set of limb points on Phobos as seen from Mars. Perform
      a consistency check using the emission angle at each point,
      where the emission angle is computed using both a reference
      ellipsoid and the actual plate model surface and surface normal.
      We expect to see an emission angle of approximately 90 degrees.

   Boundaries of visible regions on an arbitrary surface are often
   complicated point sets: boundaries of mountains and craters, if
   present, may contribute to the overall set. To make the limb
   computation tractable, we simplify the problem by using a reference
   ellipsoid for guidance. We compute a set of limb points on the
   reference ellipsoid for the target body, then use those points to
   define the latitudes and longitudes of limb points on the surface
   defined by the specified triangular shape model. As such, the set
   of limb points found by this routine is just an approximation.

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  If the target name `target' cannot be mapped
       to a body ID code, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  If the observer name `obsrvr' cannot be mapped to a body ID
       code, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   3)  If `obsrvr' and `target' map to the same NAIF integer ID codes,
       the error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If the input frame name `fixref' cannot be mapped
       to a frame ID code, the error SPICE(UNKNOWNFRAME) is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   5)  If the frame designated by `fixref' is not centered
       on the target, the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   6)  If the set size `npts' is not at least 1, the error
       SPICE(INVALIDCOUNT) is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   7)  If any of the reference ellipsoid's semi-axis lengths is
       non-positive, an error is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   8)  If radii for the target body are not available in the kernel
       pool, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   9)  If radii are available but the target body does not have three
       radii, the error SPICE(INVALIDCOUNT) is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   10) If any SPK look-up fails, an error is signaled by
       a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   11) If a DSK providing a DSK type 2 plate model has not been
       loaded prior to calling llgrid_pl02, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   12) If the segment associated with the input DLA descriptor is not
       of data type 2, the error SPICE(WRONGDATATYPE) is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   13) If a surface point cannot be computed because the ray
       corresponding to a longitude/latitude pair fails to intersect
       the target surface as defined by the plate model, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   14) If the DSK segment identified by `dladsc' is not for the
       body identified by `target', the error SPICE(DSKTARGETMISMATCH)
       is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   15) If any of the input arguments, `handle', `dladsc', `target', `et',
       `fixfrm', `abcorr', `obsrvr', or `npts', is undefined, an error
       is signaled by the Matlab error handling system.

   16) If any of the input arguments, `handle', `dladsc', `target', `et',
       `fixfrm', `abcorr', `obsrvr', or `npts', is not of the expected
       type, or it does not have the expected dimensions and size, an error
       is signaled by the Mice interface.

</pre><h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4><pre>

   Appropriate DSK, SPK, PCK, and frame kernels must be loaded by the
   calling program before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  DSK data:  a DSK file containing a plate model representing the
      target body's surface must be loaded. This kernel must contain
      a type 2 segment that contains data for the entire surface of
      the target body.

   -  SPK data: ephemeris data for target and observer must be
      loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of both
      objects relative to the solar system barycenter must be
      calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically
      ephemeris data are made available by loading one or more SPK
      files via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  PCK data: triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded
      into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a text
      PCK file via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must
      be loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK
      file.

   -  Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
      the observer and target states to the target body-fixed
      frame designated by `fixref', that definition must be
      available in the kernel pool. Typically the definitions of
      frames not already built-in to SPICE are supplied by loading
      a frame kernel.

   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.
