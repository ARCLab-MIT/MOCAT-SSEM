   CSPICE_GFOCLT determines time intervals when an observer sees one target
   body occulted by, or in transit across, another.

   The surfaces of the target bodies may be represented by triaxial
   ellipsoids or by topographic data provided by DSK files.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      occtyp   the string naming the type of occultation to find.

               [1,c1] = size(occtyp); char = class(occtyp)

               Note that transits are considered to be a type of
               occultation.

               Supported values and corresponding definitions are:

                  'FULL'               denotes the full occultation
                                       of the body designated by
                                       `back' by the body designated
                                       by `front', as seen from
                                       the location of the observer.
                                       In other words, the occulted
                                       body is completely invisible
                                       as seen from the observer's
                                       location.

                  'ANNULAR'            denotes an annular
                                       occultation: the body
                                       designated by `front' blocks
                                       part of, but not the limb of,
                                       the body designated by `back',
                                       as seen from the location of
                                       the observer.

                  'PARTIAL'            denotes a partial,
                                       non-annular occultation: the
                                       body designated by `front'
                                       blocks part, but not all, of
                                       the limb of the body
                                       designated by `back', as seen
                                       from the location of the
                                       observer.

                  'ANY'                denotes any of the above three
                                       types of occultations:
                                       'PARTIAL', 'ANNULAR', or
                                       'FULL'.

                                       'ANY' should be used to search
                                       for times when the body
                                       designated by `front' blocks
                                       any part of the body designated
                                       by `back'.

                                       The option 'ANY' must be used
                                       if either the front or back
                                       target body is modeled as
                                       a point.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in
               the string `occtyp'.

      front    the string naming the target body that occults---that
               is, passes in front of---the other.

               [1,c2] = size(front); char = class(front)

               Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code for the
               body as a string. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
               legitimate strings that designate the Moon.

               The `front' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

      fshape   the string naming the geometric model used
               to represent the shape of the front target body.

               [1,c3] = size(fshape); char = class(fshape)

               The supported options are:

                 'ELLIPSOID'     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model
                                 with radius values provided via the
                                 kernel pool. A kernel variable
                                 having a name of the form

                                    'BODYnnn_RADII'

                                 where nnn represents the NAIF
                                 integer code associated with the
                                 body, must be present in the kernel
                                 pool. This variable must be
                                 associated with three numeric
                                 values giving the lengths of the
                                 ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.

                 'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point.
                                 When a point target is specified,
                                 the occultation type must be
                                 set to 'ANY'.

                 'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]'

                     Use topographic data provided by DSK files to
                     model the body's shape. These data must be
                     provided by loaded DSK files.

                     The surface list specification is optional. The
                     syntax of the list is

                        &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                     If present, it indicates that data only for the
                     listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                     need not be available for all surfaces in the
                     list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                     associated with the target body are used.

                     The surface list may contain surface names or
                     surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                     be delimited by double quotes, for example

                        SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;

                     If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                     or IDs must be separated by commas.

                     See the -Particulars section below for details
                     concerning use of DSK data.

               The combinations of the shapes of the target bodies
               `front' and `back' must be one of:

                  One ELLIPSOID, one POINT
                  Two ELLIPSOIDs
                  One DSK, one POINT

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
               significant in the string `fshape'.

      fframe   the string naming the body-fixed, body-centered reference
               frame associated with the front target body.

               [1,c4] = size(fframe); char = class(fframe)

               Examples of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and
               'ITRF93' (for the Earth).

               If the front target body is modeled as a point, `fframe'
               should be left empty or blank.

               The `fframe' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

      back     the string naming the target body that is occulted
               by---that is, passes in back of---the other.

               [1,c5] = size(back); char = class(back)

               Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code
               for the body as a string. For example both 'MOON' and
               '301' are legitimate strings that designate the Moon.

               The `back' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

      bshape   the string naming the shape specification for the body
               designated by `back'.

               [1,c6] = size(bshape); char = class(bshape)

               The supported options are those for `fshape'. See the
               description of `fshape' above for details.

      bframe   the string naming the body-fixed, body-centered
               reference frame associated with the '`back'' target body.

               [1,c7] = size(bframe); char = class(bframe)

               Examples of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn)
               and 'ITRF93' (for the Earth).

               If the back target body is modeled as a point, `bframe'
               should be left empty or blank.

               The `bframe' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

      abcorr   the string indicating the aberration corrections to to apply
               to the state of the target body to account for one-way
               light time.

               [1,c8] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

               Stellar aberration corrections are ignored if specified,
               since these corrections don't improve the accuracy of the
               occultation determination.

               This routine accepts the same aberration corrections as does
               the Mice routine <a href="cspice_spkezr.html">cspice_spkezr</a>. See the abcorr.req
               for a detailed description of the aberration correction
               options. For convenience, the options are listed below:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction.

                  'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'LT+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'CN+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

                  'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

               The `abcorr' string lacks sensitivity to case, and to
               embedded, leading and trailing blanks.

      obsrvr   the name of the observing body.

               [1,c9] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

               Optionally, you may supply the ID code of the object as an
               integer string. For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are
               legitimate strings to supply to indicate the observer is
               Earth.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in
               the string `obsrvr'.

      step     the step size to use in the search.

               [1,1] = size(step); double = class(step)

               `step' must be shorter than any interval, within the
               confinement window, over which the specified occultation
               condition is met. In other words, `step' must be shorter
               than the shortest occultation event the user wishes to
               detect; `step' must also be shorter than the shortest time
               interval between two occultation events that occur within
               the confinement window (see below). However, `step' must not
               be *too* short, or the search will take an unreasonable
               amount of time.

               The choice of `step' affects the completeness but not
               the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
               precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
               See the discussion of the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL for
               details.

               `step' has units of TDB seconds.

      cnfine   the SPICE window that confines the time period over which
               the specified search is conducted.

               [2m,1] = size(cnfine); double = class(cnfine)

               `cnfine' may consist of a single interval or a collection
               of intervals.

               In some cases the confinement window can be used to

               below for further discussion.

      nintvls  the maximum number of intervals to return in `result'.

               [1,1] = size(nintvls); int32 = class(nintvls)

               Note: this value should equal at least the number of expected
               intervals. Recall two double precision values define
               an interval.

   the call:

      result = <b>cspice_gfoclt</b>( occtyp, front,  fshape, fframe,             ...
                              back,   bshape, bframe, abcorr,             ...
                              obsrvr, step,   cnfine, nintvls)

   returns:

      result   the SPICE window of intervals, contained within the
               confinement window `cnfine', on which the specified
               constraint is satisfied.

               [2n,1] = size(result); double = class(result)

               If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
               constraint, `result' will return with cardinality zero.

   All parameters described here are declared in the Mice include file
   MiceGF.m. See that file for parameter values.

   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL

               is the convergence tolerance used for finding
               endpoints of the intervals comprising the result
               window. SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is used to determine when
               binary searches for roots should terminate: when a
               root is bracketed within an interval of length
               SPICE_GF_CNVTOL, the root is considered to have been
               found.

               The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
               by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
               data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will
               be inferior to their precision.

</pre><h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4><pre>

   Any numerical results shown for these examples may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   1) Find occultations of the Sun by the Moon (that is, solar
      eclipses)as seen from the center of the Earth over the month
      December, 2001.

      Use light time corrections to model apparent positions of Sun
      and Moon. Stellar aberration corrections are not specified
      because they don't affect occultation computations.

      We select a step size of 3 minutes, which means we
      ignore occultation events lasting less than 3 minutes,
      if any exist.

   This routine provides a simple interface for conducting searches for
   occultation events.

   This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
   within the confinement window when a specified type of
   occultation occurs. The resulting set of intervals is returned as
   a SPICE window.

   Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
   solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
   use of this routine in user applications.

   The Search Process
   ==================

   The search for occultations is treated as a search for state
   transitions: times are sought when the state of the `back' body
   changes from &quot;not occulted&quot; to &quot;occulted&quot; or vice versa.

   Step Size
   =========

   Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows:
   first, the input step size is used to determine the time separation
   at which the occultation state will be sampled. Starting at the left
   endpoint of the interval, samples of the occultation state will be
   taken at each step. If a state change is detected, a root has been
   bracketed; at that point, the &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the state
   change occurs---is found by a refinement process, for example, via
   binary search.

   Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
   of the intervals over which the occultation state is constant:
   the step size should be shorter than the shortest occultation
   duration and the shortest period between occultations, within
   the confinement window.

   Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and
   observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
   In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
   picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
   time.

   Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
   the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
   That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


   Convergence Tolerance
   =====================

   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
   narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie. This
   refinement process terminates when the location of the root has been
   determined to within an error margin called the &quot;convergence
   tolerance.&quot; The convergence tolerance used by this routine is set
   via the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL.

   The value of SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
   tolerance doesn't limit the accuracy of solutions found by this
   routine. In general the accuracy of input data will be the limiting
   factor.

   To use a different tolerance value, a lower-level GF routine such as
   gfocce_c must be called. Making the tolerance tighter than
   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is unlikely to be useful, since the results are
   unlikely to be more accurate. Making the tolerance looser will speed
   up searches somewhat, since a few convergence steps will be omitted.
   However, in most cases, the step size is likely to have a much
   greater effect on processing time than would the convergence
   tolerance.


   The Confinement Window
   ======================

   The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
   interval within which a solution is sought.

   The confinement window also can be used to restrict a search to
   a time window over which required data (typically ephemeris
   data, in the case of occultation searches) are known to be
   available.

   In some cases, the confinement window be used to make searches
   more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
   to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
   slow search of interest must be performed. See the &quot;CASCADE&quot;
   example program in gf.req for a demonstration.


   Using DSK data
   ==============

      DSK loading and unloading
      -------------------------

      DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
      calling <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="cspice_unload.html">cspice_unload</a> or
      <a href="cspice_kclear.html">cspice_kclear</a>. See the documentation of <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> for limits on
      numbers of loaded DSK files.

      For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
      loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
      use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
      example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
      used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
      used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
      the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
      that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
      given body have different surface ID codes.


      DSK data priority
      -----------------

      A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
      files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
      given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
      intervals of the segments overlap as well.

      When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
      overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
      files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
      precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
      segment located closer to the end of the file takes
      precedence.

      When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
      segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
      both represent a surface as a set of triangular plates, the
      union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
      surface.

      Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
      Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
      in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
      required in the `fshape' and `bshape' arguments.


      Syntax of the shape input arguments for the DSK case
      ----------------------------------------------------

      The keywords and surface list in the target shape arguments
      `bshape' and `fshape' are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may
      appear in any order, for example

         &quot;DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED&quot;
         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;&quot;
         &quot;UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK&quot;

      The simplest form of the `method' argument specifying use of
      DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

         &quot;DSK/UNPRIORITIZED&quot;

      For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
      body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
      segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be
      the usual case.

      When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
      files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
      surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
      specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
      surfaces are to be used together.

      The surface list consists of the string

         &quot;SURFACES = &quot;

      followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
      identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
      string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
      names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

         Surface Name                              ID code
         ------------                              -------
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                1
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                 2
         &quot;Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;                         3

      If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
      data for surface 1 can be specified by either

         'SURFACES = 1'

      or

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;'

      Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because
      it contains blank characters.

      To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
      of the following surface lists could be used:

         'SURFACES = 2, 3'

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

         'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

      An example of a shape argument that could be constructed
      using one of the surface lists above is

         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

</pre><h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4><pre>

   1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
       the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
       Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
       roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
       to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
       roots.

       This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except that
       if the step size is non-positive, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

          - Truncation error in time values
          - Finite tolerance value
          - Errors in computed geometric quantities

       it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
       satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
       result window.

       The result window may need to be contracted slightly by the
       caller to achieve desired results. The SPICE window routine
       <a href="cspice_wncond.html">cspice_wncond</a> can be used to contract the result window.

   3)  If name of either target or the observer cannot be translated
       to a NAIF ID code, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot
       be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel
       variable having a name of the form

          'BODYnnn_RADII'

       where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with
       the body, an error is signaled by a routine in the
       call tree of this routine.

   5)  If either of the target bodies `front' or `back' coincides with
       the observer body `obsrvr', an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   6)  If the body designated by `front' coincides with that
       designated by `back', an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   7)  If either of the body model specifiers `fshape' or `bshape'
       is not recognized, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   8)  If both of the body model specifiers `fshape' and `bshape'
       specify point targets, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   9)  If one of the body model specifiers `fshape' and `bshape'
       specifies a DSK model, and the other argument does not
       specify a point target, an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   10) If a target body-fixed reference frame associated with a
       non-point target is not recognized, an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   11) If a target body-fixed reference frame is not centered at the
       corresponding target body, an error is signaled by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   12) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to compute any
       required state vector, an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   13) If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel file,
       the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   14) If a point target is specified and the occultation type is set
       to a valid value other than 'ANY', an error is signaled by a
       routine in the call tree of this routine.

   15) If the output SPICE window `result' has insufficient capacity
       to contain the number of intervals on which the specified
       occultation condition is met, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   16) If the occultation type `occtyp' is invalid, an error is
       signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   17) If the aberration correction specification `abcorr' is invalid,
       an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree of this
       routine.

   18) If either `fshape' or `bshape' specifies that the target surface
       is represented by DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for
       the specified target, an error is signaled by a routine in
       the call tree of this routine.

   19) If either `fshape' or `bshape' specifies that the target surface
       is represented by DSK data, but the shape specification is
       invalid, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   20) If any of the input arguments, `occtyp', `front', `fshape',
       `fframe', `back', `bshape', `bframe', `abcorr', `obsrvr',
       `step', `cnfine' or `nintvls', is undefined, an error is signaled
       by the Matlab error handling system.

   21) If any of the input arguments, `occtyp', `front', `fshape',
       `fframe', `back', `bshape', `bframe', `abcorr', `obsrvr',
       `step', `cnfine' or `nintvls', is not of the expected type, or it
       does not have the expected dimensions and size, an error is
       signaled by the Mice interface.

</pre><h4><a name="Files">Files</a></h4><pre>

   Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
   before this routine is called.

   The following data are required:

   -  SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data
      for the targets, source and observer that cover the time
      period specified by the window `cnfine'. If aberration
      corrections are used, the states of the target bodies and of
      the observer relative to the solar system barycenter must be
      calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically
      ephemeris data are made available by loading one or more SPK
      files via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
      semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.
      Typically these data are made available by loading a text
      PCK file via <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

   -  FK data: if either of the reference frames designated by
      `bframe' or `fframe' are not built in to the SPICE system,
      one or more FKs specifying these frames must be loaded.

   The following data may be required:

   -  DSK data: if either `fshape' or `bshape' indicates that DSK
      data are to be used, DSK files containing topographic data
      for the target body must be loaded. If a surface list is
      specified, data for at least one of the listed surfaces must
      be loaded.

   -  Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified
      in `fshape' or `bshape', the association of these names with
      their corresponding surface ID codes must be established by
      assignments of the kernel variables

         NAIF_SURFACE_NAME
         NAIF_SURFACE_CODE
         NAIF_SURFACE_BODY

      Normally these associations are made by loading a text
      kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example
      of such a set of assignments is

         NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'
         NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1
         NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499

   -  CK data: either of the body-fixed frames to which `fframe' or
      `bframe' refer might be a CK frame. If so, at least one CK
      file will be needed to permit transformation of vectors
      between that frame and the J2000 frame.

   -  SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
      kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
      (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
      (TDB).

   Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every
   time this routine is called.
