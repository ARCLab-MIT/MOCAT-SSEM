%
%  Gregorian Calendar to Julian Date.
%
%  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
%  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
%
%  Status:  support function.
%
%  Given:
%     year, month, day in Gregorian calendar (Note 1)
%
%  Returned:
%     djm0      MJD zero-point: always 2400000.5
%     djm       Modified Julian Date for 0 hrs
%
%  Notes:
%  1) The algorithm used is valid from -4800 March 1, but this
%     implementation rejects dates before -4799 January 1.
%
%  2) The Julian Date is returned in two pieces, in the usual SOFA
%     manner, which is designed to preserve time resolution.  The
%     Julian Date is available as a single number by adding djm0 and
%     djm.
%
%  3) In early eras the conversion is from the "Proleptic Gregorian
%     Calendar";  no account is taken of the date(s) of adoption of
%     the Gregorian Calendar, nor is the AD/BC numbering convention
%     observed.
